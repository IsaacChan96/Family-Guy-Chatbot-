God.  - Hey, guys. - Oh, hey, Quagmire.  How was marching band practice?  Peter, you know this is a pilot's uniform.  It represents years of specialized training.  Yeah, well, you know what else takes years  of specialized training? Crossing your eyes.  Aah! Aah! Aah! Too far! Too far!  MAN (Korean accent): Hold still.  Thank you, Korean sweatshop animator.  You've earned your nickel this week.  Where're you coming from, Quagmire?  I had to fly to Aruba, so I brought my mom along  with my \"friends and family\" discount.  Did you  Yes, Joe, I got you a magnet.  Where do you even put all those magnets, Joe?  Well, you know I have that fridge in the garage  with bags of blood in my blood type?  What's \"friends and family\"?  Oh, airline employees can get discounted tickets  for family and close friends.  What? How-how come you've never done that for us?  If I'm being honest, I've also got  a few Celeste pizzas in that fridge.  I don't know, I-I guess I just figured you guys  always have to work, or you're with your kids.  But sure, yeah, I could take you somewhere.  I'm going to San Francisco next week. You guys want to come?  San Francisco?  That city from And the Band Played On and Milk?  I'm in!  Yeah, thanks, Quagmire.  Oh, wow, this'll be great.  Hey, can you make us X-Men?  What a surprise.  Well, I'm off to San Francisco with the guys.  Okay, I'm off to Hilton Head with the girls.  - You what? - Peter,  I told you about this a month ago.  I'm going with Bonnie and Donna  to Donna's sister's time share.  Well, we can't both go on a trip at the same time.  I'm sorry, Peter, but I already have a taxi waiting.  (sighs) All right, I'll go tell the guys I'm not going.  Why is he taking his suitcase to tell the guys?  You guys, come on, we got to go now. Let's go, move it.  QUAGMIRE: I'm in the shower. It doesn't matter,  we're stealing Lois' cab.  Son of a  Oh, and the idiot took my suitcase.  Aw, he was taking me with him.  (indistinct conversations)  Ah, San Francisco.  Aah! San Francisco!  So what are we gonna do first?  I want to see the Golden Gate Bridge.  I want to see Lombard Street.  I want to see Ghirardelli Square.  Guys, guys.  Let's get lesbian haircuts and see 'em all.  Come to my window   Oh   Crawl inside   Wait by the light of the moon   Come to my window   I'll be home soon   I'll be home, I'll be home   I'm coming home   All right, the gay jokes are out of the way,  now let's get down to business.  Okay, guys, this is the original Levi Jeans factory,  created by Levi Strauss in the year 1853  so that gold miners could wear a comfortable yet durable fabric.  This is boring.  Well, then you plan the vacation!  Aah!  Peter, Peter, calm down, it-it's okay,  we'll-we'll do whatever you want.  All right, if you promise.  I was thinkin' we could tuck our shirts into our pants,  put on huge helmets, and ride Segways.  ALL: We're not from here! We're not from here!  You guys, look.  It's Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry.  Oh, my God, Steph, I'm such a big fan.  Thanks. It's nice to meet you.  Hey, I know we just met, but can I sit on your lap  during your next post-game press conference?  Sure, I don't see why not.  This is exciting for the whole Bay Area,  to be just four games away from the championship  Dad, I dooked.  That other team's not just gonna go away, though.  We've got to stay focused, keep doing what we've been doing.  Fat lady. Dad, Dad, a fat lady.  Yeah, I-I see her, Peter.  Make her go.  That's not how we talk to people.  Make her go.  WOMAN: I'll leave.  Yay! I'm learning bad lessons.  Wow. So that was San Francisco.  I didn't realize how hilly it was gonna be.  Thanks again for taking us, Quagmire.  Hey, no problem.  Hey, you know, we're here early.  You guys want a little tour of the plane?  Yeah, that'd be great.  Normally I'd just go to Hudson News  and pretend to be the most important guy there.  Can I help you?  Yes, I will have eight Dasanis  and a JD Power & Associates.  (cheering, whistling)  Wow, this place is cool.  Yeah. What do all these buttons do?  Like, what's this red one?  Oh, that's a voice filter, so the passengers always think  the pilot is a 60-year-old Midwestern white man.  What? That's impossible.  Hi y'all, this is Cleveland.  AUTHORITATIVE VOICE: Good afternoon, folks,  this is Captain Dale Clark up here in the flight deck.  We're way up in the air.  We've reached our cruising altitude of 37,000 feet.  Y'all get ready to watch Big Momma's House.  Our in-flight entertainment today  will be Under the Tuscan Sun.  Ooh, I like that.  I hear it's good.  Hey, what's this button? \"Autopilot\"?  Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself when I need a break.  W-What do you mean, \"a break\"?  You don't have to fly the plane?  Of course I do. I just take a short break sometimes.  Short break? It looks like you had time  to put together the 10,000-piece Lego Hogwarts.  You don't have to touch it, Joe, you can just say you noticed it.  And what's this booth over here?  Oh, that's my back-in-time box.  I go inside, magically go back in time,  and then come out and react to the fact that we're flying.  By God, we're levitating.  That's just a box full of costumes.  It's my back-in-time box!  What the hell, Quagmire? So-so, basically,  your job is just goofin' off.  That's not true.  I broke Gandalf in half.  It's Dumbledore!  Screw you guys. You know, being a pilot  is hard work. Look, I tried to be nice  and take you fellas on a free trip,  and all you can do is crap all over my job.  I was a Navy pilot, you jerks.  Get the hell out of my cockpit.  Joke's on him. I farted just before he kicked us out.  QUAGMIRE: Ugh. Oh, God!  All right, let's see what's in the in-flight magazine.  Muscular old guy.  Already filled-in crossword puzzle.  Ooh, this is food for different routes I'm not on.  All right, time to use the potty.  Don't say \"potty.\" You're an adult.  Okay, nobody move!  Oh, my God, those guys in first class have guns.  Cleveland, just be happy with what you have.  Don't envy people.  No, Peter, we're being hijacked.  Close the cockpit door!  (Eastern European accent): This plane now belongs to us.  You move, you're dead.  So nobody try to get smart.  Mm, page 100. Mm.  Control tower, this is flight 364.  We have a hijacking in progress.  - Our flight has been - (static)  Oh, damn it, they jammed the transmission.  I'm gonna have to go to the backup communication system.  Hello? Can you hear me?  This is Flight 364.  We're being hijacked.  I can hear you Oh!  This is your last chance.  Open the door, or your copilot gets it.  No. I'm landing at the closest airfield,  which is less than an hour away. So just let him go,  'cause you're not getting control of this plane.  (grunts)  QUAGMIRE: Aah! Jimmy! Oh, my God!  Why are you doing this?  America needs to be punished  for supporting the other side of my country's civil war.  Which country?  Do you really want to know,  or are you just asking because  we're gonna be on a plane for a while  and you think you should make small talk?  The second thing.  Open the door, or I'll start  - executing passengers. - (screaming)  Man, coming on this trip was a terrible idea.  I know, now I wish I'd just stayed home  and finished my remake of Inside Out.  I'm Joy.  I'm Sadness.  I'm Anger.  I'm Disgust.  I'm Poo.  (stomach growling)  Ooh, I need to use the bathroom.  PETER (muffled): Yay! I win!    We interrupt this program with a special report.  A flight from San Francisco to Quahog  has lost contact with air traffic control.  Oh, my God, that's your father's flight.  Government officials  are monitoring the situation closely.  I'll be here to update you as this story progresses.  Coming up on the midday news, a couple in their 30s  gets married without their dog being in the wedding.  You're not gonna believe their story.  What's it gonna be?  Are you going to open this door,  or am I going to start killing people?  QUAGMIRE: I'm not opening it.  Excuse me, I'd just like to ask the mom behind me  who told me to stop watching Game of Thrones on my laptop  if I'm still \"the worst person on this plane.\"  You, fat guy. Get up here!  Aah!  (grunts)  Last chance. Open the door,  or this idiot gets it.  Don't open it, Quagmire. It's not worth it.  QUAGMIRE: Okay.  Wait wait, what?  That-that was quick.  I'm sorry, Peter, but I have to think about the whole plane.  There's over 150 passengers back there,  several of whom are in our Commander's Club,  and to them I'd like to issue a special welcome.  Oh, man, we got to help Peter!  Those crazy European guys are gonna kill him!  You know, I have a gun in the bag I checked.  If we can get to the galley,  we can take the elevator down to the cargo hold.  Good idea, Joe.  Oh, man, it feels like we're in one of those hijacking movies.  You're right, it does. There's even an impatient businessman  who really wants to reach his destination  so he can conduct more business.  Can't you see how important I am?  My shirt is blue, but the collar is white.  It's the same shirt!  Quick, he's distracted.    (quietly): \"Get off my plane.\"  \"Get off my plane.\"  - What's that, now? - Hmm?  Nothing.  \"Always bet on black.\"  \"Always bet on black.\"  - Did you say something? - I don't think so.  - \"Double trouble!\" - \"Double trouble!\"  That's it. We found it.  What the hell?!  Hey! Two of the passengers are missing!  Okay, you guys watch the main cabin.  I'll go find them.  I'll take this fat guy as a human shield.  Oh, nice. Last guy picked for dodgeball,  first guy for human shield.  - (indistinct chatter) - Everybody be quiet!  There's another update!  Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker.  The search for a missing airliner continues,  as speculation grows that the plane has been hijacked.  Oh, this is all so awful!  What will our lives be like if our husbands don't make it?  LOIS:  Thank you for being a friend     Travel down the road and back again   Your heart is true   You're a pal and a confidant   Thank you for being a friend   (song ends)  Oh, my God! Now I want Dad to die!  Hey, Joe, look at me.  Do I look like Mickey the Mouse?  Get out of people's stuff!  Ah, here's my bag.  (elevator whirring)  Hey! What are you two doing down here?  Oh, someone's shipping live lobsters.  Yum.  Prepare to die.  You first!  That's what you think.  (beeping)  Peter! Grab on to something!  Uh-oh. I grabbed my own belt.  (shouting)  (grunting)  (choking)  (grunting)  (shouts)  (shouts)  QUAGMIRE: Attention, passengers, I know we're being hijacked,  but I would be remiss if I didn't point out  that we're presently passing over Yosemite National Park.  Wow! That is truly awe-inspiring!  It certainly is.  And you know what you don't see from up here?  Borders.    (screaming)  Die in hell, Eurotrash!  Hang on, Peter!  Holy crap, that was close.  Joe, how'd you know that lever would open the landing gear?  Wheels are my expertise, Peter.  I notice every wheel in a room as soon as I enter.  Special delivery from the U.S. of A.!  (click)  Aw, rats.  My bullets are in my shaving kit.  (screaming)  (grunting)  Get off my pl Double trouble!  Sorry. Come on, man!  (cheering and applause)  Oh, my God, you guys did it!  We're saved!  Yep, we wrapped this up quicker  than the treaty signing at Appomattox.  So, if I sign this, the war is over,  we surrender, and we still get to be dicks forever?  (chuckling): Okay, you win.  You can all relax now, everybody!  We're ten minutes away from landing  at an airfield in Nevada.  Looks like you'll make that business meeting after all.  Great! Thanks for keeping us in the sky, boys.  (Eastern European accent): Now reach for it.  You're one of the hijackers, too?!  Yes. I was in reserve in case the plan went awry.  And now I can finally get into the cockpit  and execute our plan:  crashing this plane into the ultimate symbol  of American materialism,  Las Vegas.  You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas,  but I never thought I'd lose my life there.  - Did you just think of that? - Yeah, just now.  You know, you are seriously funny, man.  I know I crap on you a lot, but sometimes,  when I'm driving, I think about stuff you say and I laugh.  - Thank you, Peter. - No, thank you.  Very good. We are less than 20 minutes from Las Vegas.  Get ready to say good-bye to your precious Rita Rudner.  Is-is your plan just to kill Rita Rudner?  No. We're going to crash into the biggest hotel on the Strip!  Killing Rita Rudner will just be the custard on the dumpling.  You know, we never quite nailed down  what region you guys are from.  (news theme playing)  Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker with the latest  on the hijacking crisis.  As you can see, I've taken off my blazer  to show the severity of the situation.  We understand the plane has been found by satellite.  It's apparently veered off its flight plan  and is headed for Las Vegas.  The government, fearing the worst,  is considering shooting it down.  Now here's an over-the-top news graphic.  - (dramatic music playing) - (screaming)  ANNOUNCER: Nightmare over Vegas.  (explosions)  - (slot machine music, coins clinking) - Hijack Jackpot.  Oh, look, there's one guy who slept through this whole thing.  Hey, buddy, wake up.  We're all about to die.  What? What are you talking about?  Yeah, I thought I should wake you up.  Nobody wants to die in their sleep.  Oh, my God! No! I have a family!  There you go.  Only a few more minutes until your country pays  for its imperialistic sins.  Us? What about you?!  Like-like, how come you Eastern European guys  can't be quieter in pornos?  I mean, nobody's ever been like, \"Yeah, yeah, more guy noises.\"  They ask us to do that to cover up the sound  of children playing nearby.  Now shut up and get ready to die.  So, uh, you ever been to Vegas before?  No.  Well, I think you're gonna  flip for it!  (shouting)  (grunts)    Attention, passengers, the plane  (groaning, moaning)  Oh, come on! Doesn't anybody pay attention to the sign?!  That was some quick thinking, Glenn.  And look! Even that plane with all the missiles is impressed.  Missiles? That's a military fighter jet!  He's here to shoot us down!  - Or \"she.\" - What?!  They must think the hijackers still control the plane!  And our communications are jammed,  so we can't even tell them everything's okay!  Don't worry, I'll signal to 'em.  Hey! We knocked out all the bad guys!  See? We don't need your help!  We kicked their asses and we have their guns!  I've got a visual on the terrorists.  They've got a hostage in a blue shirt with a white collar.  He must be an important businessman.  COMMANDER: Copy that. Prepare to engage.  (whirring)  Oh, good, he's movin' away.  No, he isn't. He's g getting in position to fire!  He thinks we're gonna crash into the Strip!  Everybody in your seats!    Frank Caliendo does a 5:00 show?  Quagmire, land this plane!    We've been hit!  Oh, God, this is it!  We're gonna die!  Like hell we are!  We're gonna make it.    We're going too fast!  We're gonna crash into that lake!  Oh, no, we're not!    (screaming)  QUAGMIRE: Oh, yeah, right there. That's good.  And now to discharge the plane's fire retardant.  PETER/QUAGMIRE/JOE/CLEVELAND: Giggity.  (whirring)  (indistinct radio transmission)  Wow, Quagmire, thanks for saving all of our lives.  We're sorry for saying your job was easy.  Yeah, you're the best damn pilot in the world.  He's right. What you did up there was amazing.  Thanks, guys, that means a lot.  Boy, that was quite a trip, wasn't it?  Sure was. And we learned a lot about blue jeans,  - didn't we, guys? - Yes, yes, we did, yeah.  - That's right, Peter. - Thank you for planning a wonderful day.  (whirring)  - Cleveland! - Joe!  Peter!    Dad, I was really worried,  so I pulled a record of your credit card purchases  in San Francisco, and I saw some things  I think you'd prefer to keep private.  We'll talk later, Chris.  I think we will.  I do believe we will.  Well, let's head home.  I know I, for one, am ready to put all this behind us.  Sounds good.  Oh, yeah, in case we didn't say, this was Spirit Airlines.  COMMENTATOR: Wide open in the end zone.  (crowd cheering on TV) ouchdown Patriots!  Beautiful pass by Tom Brady.  Yeah, Brady!  He's awesome.  I can't believe Gisele gets to sleep with him.  I wish I was a supermodel.  Hey, it's a commercial.  Jerome, switch over to the RedZone.  Screw that, I say we put on the BoneZone.  - What's that? - Oh, it's awesome.  They show every sex scene on TV  without all the boring dialogue and plot.  (remote clicks) Okay, once again,  nothing is happening on Homeland,  but over on Masters of Sex, Lizzie Caplan  is hooked up to electrodes and getting it from a guy  who sounds American, but probably isn't.  Hey, we're gonna split the screens now  because my producer is telling me on Game of Thrones  we got a malnourished Albino plowing a girl  in a tub as he names dragons.  Oh, there's a Bone Zone alert for Girls,  which we'll ignore,  'cause it's Gabby Hoffmann Donald Ducking it.  Last time we went to that, we lost a lot of subscribers,  and we're keeping an eye on The Knick.  We don't want to bring you dead boobs,  but if they're alive, we'll get you over there.  (phone chirps) Ah, crap.  It's almost 3:00. I got to get out of here.  For what? It's Sunday.  Eh, the airline's making us all attend a seminar  about what do to if someone flies a drone  into your flight path.  Yeah, I hear that kind of obnoxious behavior  is very big right now in the dangerous idiot community.  Really? I didn't see that in the newsletter this month.  Just a big article about how to tailgate a speeding fire truck  to get places faster.  (siren wailing)  (laughs) Wait till they get to the golf course  and find out there's no fire.  No, It's a serious problem.  Nowadays any moron  could just order a drone online.  - Oh. - There's no regulation.  - Oh! - And most of them have cameras  so people can spy on whoever they want  and invade their privacy.  (louder): Oh!  Peter, are you ordering a drone right now?  You bet your ass I am.  Owning a drone is gonna be a blast.  Even more fun than when I had breakfast in bread.  Hi, Lois. It's a great morning,  no matter how you slice it.  Yeah, I don't know what this is Peter,  but we're four months behind on our mortgage.  Well, that's odd.  It's not like we're short on dough.  I'm taking the kids and I'm staying at my parents'  for a while.  That's the yeast of my concerns.    Ah, Brian, you finally made it.  I'm having a tea party. Sit down.  Yeah, you texted me, like, 80 times.  Look, Stewie, I don't have time to sip air  and pretend to eat a wooden hamburger patty.  Yeah? Tell me why you don't have time.  All right, I have time.  And there's nothing pretend about this.  Real tea, real milk,  and the best honey you'll ever taste in your whole life.  Wow, this is good.  Where'd you buy the honey?  I didn't, I'm raising bees.  You're raising bees?  Like-like a beekeeper?  Yup, Mom missed soccer registration,  so this is my weekends.  Mmm, I got to say, you're good at it.  You know, you could probably sell this stuff.  Really? You think it's that good?  Yeah, plus it's local.  It's straight from the hive.  People at farmers' markets would go nuts for this.  You know, you could probably charge, like, $20, $30 a jar.  Oh, now I'm excited about this, Brian.  I feel like an eighth grader who just had sex.  So, you go all the way?  Oh, yeah.  I'm gonna need some proof.  Hmm, how can I prove it?  Maybe with Father O'Leary's briefs.  - Oh! - The king.  (crying): He said he loved me.    All right, time to take flight.  Drone of Arcadia.  Oh, Amber Tamblyn.  I love that show.  Now married to David Cross.  (drone powers up)  Can I have a turn? I want a turn.  No.  Hey, does Cleveland have a bald spot?  No.  Hey, what's this do?  (airplane engine)  (motor mower)  (grunting)  (splash)  JOE: Check it out, here comes a hawk.  (hawk screeches)  (wings flapping)  Uh-oh.  What's happening?  - (hawk screeching) - Ah, no!  I don't think this is consensual!  JOE: Look at that pervert squirrel just watching.  (crunch)  (drone engine starting)  Oh, crap, it's busted.  And I bet it's completely traumatized.  I wasn't traumatized actually.  It was planned.  Part of the games we play.    I've been a bad drone.  (knocking on door)  Peter, you've been knocking a while.  I don't think anyone's in there.  Yeah, look at all this mail.  Maybe he's on vacation or something.  Oh, my God, he's dead!  And his face and earlobes are missing.  (cat yowls, all scream)  Oh, that's a relief.  It's just the cat that ate his face and ears off.    So, Brian, this is my hive.  Now, how many bees do you think are in here?  I don't know, a-a million?  No, it's 4,000.  Now that seems like nothing  because of your idiot million guess.  All right, now, if you're going to sell honey  at the farmers' market, you need to practice.  So you be the salesman, and I'll be the customer.  Ooh, what do we have here?  Uh, honey.  Like the sign says.  I find your attitude cavalier.  May I speak to your manager?  Stewie, come on.  I'm sorry, is there a problem here?  I was just in the back and I heard a commotion.  - How do we have a back? - I simply came here  to enquire about honey  and your employee spoke to me loudly and with profanity.  Stewie, this is ridiculous.  Brian, please, I trust that this handsome young customer  knows what he's talking about.  Oh, my, and I thought only bees pour on the honey.  I'm going inside.  So, are you from around here?  No I'm just in town for the John Singer Sargent exhibit  - at the museum. - (gasps) Really?  I've been looking for an excuse to go again.  Well, looks like I won't need that audio tour.  Great. Give me one minute.  Let me text my fiancÃ©e.  Your what?    - (phone beeps) - That was Bonnie.  She said they already sold the house behind us.  Poor Mr. Seigel.  - (party music plays) - What the hell is that?  MAN: Yeah, that party bus is awesome.  MAN 2: Yeah, let's go, let's go.  - Here we go, baby. - Yeah!  Oh, God, please don't let that be our new neighbors.  - What is it? - Some kind of crazy van  with the number 87 on the side.  - (dreaming music) - 87?  That's not a van, Lois, that's a party bus.  Rob Gronkowski's party bus!  Who's that?  Only the star tight end  of the New England Patriots  and America's most athletic Polish.    Did you guys see?  Oh, my God, that was Rob Gronkowski.  (men continue cheering)  (tyres skid)  (all breathing heavily)  (out of breath): Am I running?  Is this what running is?  I hate it. (panting)    What's up, butt munchers?  That's us! He called us butt munchers!  We're butt munchers!  (all laughing and cheering)  All right, time to Gronk a dump in my new house.  Oh. My. God!  Our new neighbor is Gronk.  Hey, I'm your new mailman.  Former star of The Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno.  On any other day that would be so exciting.  Please give me my mail and go.  What the hell are you doing?  I wanted to bring over something to welcome Gronk  to the neighborhood. So I scraped all the cool ranch  off of 15 bags of Doritos.  You're bringing him a bowl of powder?  Yeah, I thought he could eat it by the fistful  or rub it on his balls.  Peter, I don't know what you're so excited about.  Rob Gronkowski is probably the worst neighbor we could ask for.  You know he's gonna be partying day and night.  It's not like it's that tasty piece of ass, Julian Edelman.  Now there's a Patriot you can get excited about.  I know he's a wide receiver, but if he's giving, I'm taking.  (gruff voice): I'll take it all.  I'll take it wherever.  (fizzy drink shaking)  Ah!  (relieved sigh) Anyway,  go suck up to your big dumb monster.  I'll be here hooking the \"G\" to thoughts of Edelman.  (can noise)  (doorbell rings)  So, what'd you get him, Cleveland?  Oreo middles.  Whoa, four standing dogs?  No, we're people, sir.  Um, Mr. Gronk?

What you said is not anything.  And check out the shower!  Ultra Sunrise Monster Energy Drink.  Sponsored by Monster Energy Drink.  Why do you keep saying what things are sponsored by?  My manager said if I don't,  I won't go to heaven.  Sponsored by SMS Audio Sweatproof Sport Headphones.  Well, you were right,  the farmers' market is wonderful.  You've got your yoga pants moms,  you got your mixed-race kids riding a pony,  a confused Jerome  What is this?  A vegetable parking lot?  Now, remember to tell customers  that this honey is farm-to-table.  We're not a restaurant, that doesn't make any sense.  Doesn't have to.  Say anything-to-anything,  people lose their minds.  Just so you know,  this is all grass-to-bottle.  - Ooh! - I know, right?  That'll be $68.  Is this a superfood?  Total superfood. Full of GMOs.  GMOs are bad.  No GMOs whatsoever.  Amazing.  Wow, this is great,  we've only been here an hour  and we're almost totally sold out.  Yes, I didn't see that coming.  Just like Dan Cortese  didn't see the end of the '90s coming.  ALL: Three  two  one  Happy New Year!  (crackling)  Dan Cortese was the only thing in the entire world  affected by Y2K.  (party music playing)  Grovers, you made it!  Here, have a beer.  Thanks.  Hey, Gronk, you know, there's something  I always wanted to ask you.  When you know you have single coverage,  do you give a hand signal to Brady,  or is it just eye contact?  I don't know,  want to see me dance?  Well, no, I ask because sometimes  you're being covered by a little guy,  and then you and Brady'll look at each other and  A-Am I am I supposed to touch you?  What what am I what am I doing here?  Oh, I'm sorry, bro. What was the question?  I ju I just want to know if you and Brady have, like, a  Like, a secret hand signal or something.  Whoa, that is top secret,  but lean in and I'll tell you.  (belches)  How rude.  Hey, want to meet my family?  These are my brothers.  Actually, one of them is my dad,  I'm not sure which.  Probably the gray-haired one  with the whiskey-face sunburn?  Oh, it's an honor to meet you, sir.  You must be very proud.  Hell yeah.  I think every dad's dream  is taking his son's sloppy seconds.  Is your mom here, too?  They don't have a mom.  My ex-wife raised them,  God bless her, but genetically,  they're a product of me blammin' onto a side of beef.  All right, since we sold out so fast,  we've got to make these bees more productive,  get them to make more honey.  How are we gonna do that?  Steroids, Brian.  This here is the same stuff  that turned Barry Bonds' head  into a prize-winning squash.  Okay. Well, how much are we supposed to give them?  Hmm.  It says this is enough for a horse, so,  I don't know, how many bees is a horse?  Well, you can't fit a horse in this box,  so I'd just use the whole thing.  That makes sense.  Barry Bonds says that's too much steroids.  Time for bed, Barry.  (grunts)  Turn down for what   (distant):  Turn down for what   God, they're still going?  Peter, this is exactly what I told you would happen!  Not so much fun anymore, is it?  (music stops, applause) Oh, thank God,  maybe they're wrapping it up.  Noise   Noise!   Loud noise, noise   And a Civil War cannon.   (cannon fires)  Damn it, I can't take anymore!  He is the worst neighbor ever.  You won't believe what he did yesterday.  GRONK: Hey, Grover, catch!  (techno music playing)  (cheering)  (music stops)  Uh, listen, Gronk, um,  it's gettin' kind of late.  Don't you think maybe it's time to call it a night?  Yeah, sure.  Hey, you ever seen a nard explode?  A a what?

MAN 4: I'm the dad!  I'm sorry, you were right all along.  But don't worry, I'll take care of it.  Well, you better do something soon.  I can't live like this.  I know. That guy's more annoying  than going to an Italian restaurant  with someone who's been to Italy.  They call this a trattoria?  More like a ristorante to me.  Look at that fresco.  Supposed to be the hills of Elba?  Not once you've seen 'em.  Are you ready to order?  Si. Let me handle this, Peter.  Two spaghettis and a chicken fingers.  God, look at all the honey the bees made!  Those steroids were a great idea, Stewie.  Hey, look, that bee is trying to get our honey.  (chuckling): Okay, Mr. Bee,  we'll give you the employee discount.  After all, you  - (yells) - Holy crap!  That thing just lifted a whole jar of honey!  Oh, God, do you think that's one of our steroid bees?  (buzzing)  Well, this one's wearing a hoodie as a shirt.  So, yeah, I think these are ours.  Stewie, I have a bad feeling abo  Oh, God, it just ate the other bee!  Okay, so a few of them had a bad reaction to  - (buzzing) - Oh, crap.  (buzzing continues)  Oh, my God. Brian, run!  (tires screeching)  I think maybe giving those bees steroids  was a bad idea.  - (splat) - (gasps)  Turn on the wipers!  (Brian and Stewie yelling)  (muffled music playing)  You sure this is gonna work, Peter?  Absolutely.  Gronk went to the University of Arizona,  and everyone who went to the University of Arizona  believes leprechauns are real.  And since Cleveland already owns a green suit and a top hat  This is my Easter clothes.  (doorbell rings)  Whoa, a leprechaun!  Say the thing.  (in Irish accent): Top of the morning to you,  Mr. Gronkowski.  Have you any interest in a pot of gold?  All you have to do is move to Tallahassee!  Wait a minute,  this is just a disguise!  Aah, son of a bitch!  What's going on here?  Are you guys trying to get rid of me?  Yeah, we're tryin' to get rid of you!  Why?  'Cause you're a pain in the ass to live next to!  I mean, what the hell, Gronk?  Why you got to be like this?  You're a millionaire,  you have the sweetest job in the world,  you can do whatever you want.  Why you got to act like such an idiot all the time?  It's not a choice, Grover.  But rather, an obligation.  You see, I've been groomed for this  my entire life.  Scoring touchdowns,  making people laugh,  punishing my body,  enduring the pain.  All in the name of entertainment.  Don't you understand?  I'm a commodity, a product.  A modern day gladiator.  You ask about the whys and the wherefores  behind the boorish facade?  The answer is simple:  I play the jester because society deems it necessary.  Also, I'm (bleep) insane!  (laughing)  Eat a butt, fatty!  Gronk ain't going nowhere!  Oh, that's it!  (all grunting)  Oh, cool, we're fighting?  You guys mind if I eat while I beat you up?  (grunting)  (tires screeching)  What the hell are we supposed to do?  We're surrounded!  Hang on, I got this.  \"Meg, come outside.  We have Pinkberry.\"  - (buzzing) - (Meg yelling)  Ow! Ow, ow! Stop stop it!  All right, they're distracted,  let's go!  Quick! We just have to get rid of the queen!  She's in the hive!  What's that gonna do?  The bees instinctively stay with the queen,  so if she's gone, they'll follow her!  Okay, great, but how we gonna do it?  (buzzing)  (all straining)  (grunting)  You guys are bad fighters.  That's his third sub.  Ah, cool!  Honey rain!  Aah, oh, my God,  is that a bee?!  You have bees here?  Uh, yeah, it's the world.  (buzzing)  Holy crap!  There's a ton of them!  Dad, start up the party bus!  We're moving!  DAD GRONKOWSKI: Bees?  Yeah, bees!  And they're showing blitz!  We got to leave on two!  (buzzing)  (party music playing)  (tires screeching)  You think their Wi-Fi is \"Vag-Town\"?  Yeah, that's probably them.  Look at that, no password.  Oh, well, thank goodness  we finally have our neighborhood back.  Yeah, now maybe Wilson  can move back in and  give me homespun wisdom over the fence.  Peter, that was Home Improvement.  It's exhausting  that you never just go with something I say.  Coming up, yesterday's brisket.  (belches, blows)  But first, breaking news:  Rob Gronkowski has been suspended from the Patriots  following a failed drug test  that showed evidence of steroids in his system.  The star athlete claims he has no idea  how the banned substance got into his body.  Oh, no way!  That's terrible.  When pressed for further comment,  Mr. Gronkowski said simply,  \"Grover, go long.\"  Uh-oh.  (crash)         Hey, do you think homeless people  ever have sex with each other?  Probably. But I don't want to think about it.  I know for a fact they do.  I spend most of my day breaking up  - in-progress homeless sex. - I bet it stink.  Oh, it stink all right.  So we talking group stuff or just one-on-one?  Oh, anything goes. Whatever you can fit under a tarp.  There's a major hot spot behind the Dumpster  at The Cheesecake Factory.  Hey, what's up with the menus at The Cheesecake Factory?  Why they got to be so big?  Yeah, and why does their menu have ads?  I go there for dinner, not to shop for appliances.  Hey, you know what, guys? This right here,  this rambling, boring conversation containing  already-made-before observations,  this could be a podcast.  Ah. That's actually not a bad idea.  Really? A podcast? Don't you have to be  some sort of whiz kid to do those?  Uh, definitely not anyone with a computer can make one.  Well, that's it We're \"anyone.\"  Let's do a podcast from right here in the booth.  Who's in?  - Let's do it! - Yeah, sure.  Is it happening? Are we doing it now?  Awesome! We haven't done anything as a group  since we went birdwatching.  PETER (WHISPERING): Guys, look.  It's the yellow-headed puffin face.  OTHERS: Oh! Ooh!  PETER: It's a solitary creature.  It's feathered crown is designed to scare away mates.  It's known to swell its face  to assert dominance when threatened.  CLEVELAND: What does it eat, Peter?  PETER: Gin and whatever's in the bowl at the airport bar.    I said, damn, what a wild couple of days.  Anyways, 'sup with you guys?  Sorry, amigo, not interested.  (SNEEZES)  This is what happens when you lick your spilled latte  off the steering wheel.  She did that. She's gross.  - Lois, are you okay? - Ugh. Yeah.  It's just my allergies. They've been awful.  (SNIFFS) I can't figure out what it is.  (SNEEZES)  Maybe it's Brian.  He practically sleeps on top of you.  You could be allergic to him.  Hey, here's an idea, Chris  why don't you mind your own business?  You know, I did read that people  could develop allergies to their pets.  Brian, maybe you shouldn't sleep in our bedroom  - for a little while. - What?  Well, then where am I supposed to sleep?  How about in your own apartment, like a grown-up?  Do you have a problem with me, Chris?  Why don't you sleep in Stewie's room?  There's plenty of space.  Roomies? Dude! This'll be so ill!  - Who are you? - I'll tell you who.  Your new roommate!  (SNEEZES, GROANS)  I'm gonna go take a shower  so I can blow my nose into my hands.  (GRUNTS)  Damn it! I hate this house.  - Morning, honey! - Go to hell!    All right, you guys, podcast time.  We got the equipment and the perfect business plan  give our show away for free, and tell no one how to find it.  Ready?  Hey there, the Net,  welcome to the first episode of Thanks for the Clamories.  I'm here with Glenn Quagmire,  - Hi. - Cleveland Brown  - and - Hello.  (SIGHS) And Joe Swanson.  Yo-zah!  All right, Quagmire, what do you got for us?  Let's make a clam-ory.  Okay, this is yes or no. Y-You ready, Peter?  Yes or no. French toast.  - Yes. - French fries.  - Yes. - French kissing.  I-I don't know. These questions are weird.  Okay, okay, someone else.  Cleveland, yes or no.  - Velcro shoes. - Hmm, Velcro shoes.  Woo-whee, this is a tough one.  I remember the first time I saw me a pair of 'cro's.  They were on the feet of Spunky Tesik.  Man, they was dandy  Every time we played touch football,  Spunky would step in a pile of dog poo.  You can wash a shoe, but you can't really wash a lace.  That's why Spunky made the change.  That's the thing about Velcro shoes.  Quiet going on, noisy coming off.  That rip! Spunky's mama thought he was an intruder.  Shot him right in the face.  Had an open casket at the funeral.  But only open on the middle part  To this day, every time I see a pile of dog doo,  I take a step in it just for Spunky.  So to answer the question, I'm gonna have to say  both yes and no.  All right, that's all the time we got.  I'd like to thank our sponsor, the U.S. Postal Service.  When you want something expensive thrown on your porch  and stolen, you want the U.S. Postal Service.  What the hell was that?  I know! Cleveland, you ruined the whole podcast.  Yeah, if I wanted to hear a black guy ramble like a lunatic,  - I'd watch Family Feud. - Yeah, I mean, that was worse  than an Italian guy describing someone's sexuality.  Anyway, my brother Louie, he's a  he's a little off to the side, you know?  Uh, foofy. Uh, up to the knuckle.  He's a he's a backwards mechanic.  - Likes to play in the dirt. - You mean gay?  - (SCREAMS) - Mama!  - (SOBBING) - Marone! Peter!  Mama, Louie's not gay, he's  he's creative.    Hey, Stewie, thanks for letting me stay in your room.  Oh, Brian, please It's our room now.  Hey, what are we gonna do tonight?  Ooh, maybe we should watch that movie about Freud  where Michael Fassbender repeatedly spanks  Keira Knightley to orgasm?  - You saw that movie? - I saw that scene.  (WHISTLES)  So, I was thinking this could be your area.  Okay, yeah, yeah. This is great.  And fair warning Some of the books are pop-up,  - so don't be alarmed. - Aah! Son of a bitch!  Frickin' bird came out of nowhere!  You know, I have a good feeling about this, Brian.  After all, you certainly can't be any worse  than the last roommate I had.  - What the? - Please don't cry.  She's already very angry at me.  LOIS: Peter, where are you? You will wash your hands  after you poop.  Shh, shh.  (WHISPERS): I won't.    You know, this is exciting.  Our second podcast.  All right, but listen up, Cleveland.  No more of your long stories, all right?  Yeah, people aren't used to boring podcasts.  Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose they ought to call me \"Jelly,\"  'cause sometimes I get on a roll.  That. That.  J N-None of that.  Welcome once again to Thanks for the Clamories.  Okay, common question that everybody thinks about.  How many fourth-graders you think you could take at once?  - What? - I mean, obviously, if you had to fight  against a million fourth-graders, you'd lose.  So, like, what's what's the real number?  Like, what's the legitimate number of fourth-graders  that you could successfully take on?  Let's say a hundred. That sounds reasonable.  Oh, no way. A hundred and you're dead.  - Why are we fighting, now? - 'Cause they're idiots.  Did they say something about my mother?  What? Yes. Okay, yeah, yeah, we'll say yes.  - Oh, then a baker's dozen. - What kind of weapons?  Only what's available in the schoolyard.  You could really mess up some kids with a chain from a swing.  Just da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!  All right, tell you what I'd do, I'd back into a bathroom stall,  and just start kickin'. Dead! Dead! Dead!  Keep comin'! Dead! Give 'em a narrow entry point,  make 'em come in single file.  Dead! Dead! Anyway, I guess I'm trying to say  800 fourth-graders.  Why are we talking about killing kids?  People are gonna hate this. Peter, do something else, quick.  I'll-I'll uh, what if I play some kick-ass music?  You've got to know when to hold 'em   Kick-ass? This is not kick-ass.  Wait, hang on, hang on, I'll find something.  (TECHNO BEAT PLAYS ALONG WITH \"THE GAMBLER\")  You're playing two songs at once.  - What even is this? - I-I don't know.  I'm just pressing buttons!  I got to admit, it does have a groove.  Look! Those people are even dancing to it.  (WITH TECHNO BEAT):  Every gambler knows   That the secret to survivin'   Aw, great! I accidentally started Chris's birth video.  LOIS (ON VIDEO): Ow! O-O-O-O-O-Ow! Ow!  Ow!  Ow! Kill me!  Hey, what's that song you're playing?  I don't know, it's just random garbage from my computer.  Oh, you're a deejay! That's perfect!  I own a nightclub for cocaine people and Armenians.  I need noise. You available?  - We're in! - Great!  I'll see you guys Wednesday at 2:00 a.m.  What the hell was that? We're supposed to be doing a podcast.  Peter, I don't know if you noticed,  but the podcast was a disaster.  Yeah, and we were looking for something to do as a foursome.  But how can I be a deejay?  I'm just a guy with a laptop and an inflated self-image.  Trust me, you're perfect.  All right, sounds good. Let's do this.  Okay, but hold on. I got four quarters on Golden Tee.  (GRUNTS)  How am I doing?  Good job, Joe!

I could totally be a deejay.  For God's sake, John Travolta's a pilot.  TRAVOLTA (OVER SPEAKERS): This is your captain speaking.  We have reached our cruising altitude.  It is now safe to take off your wigs and be gay.  (DING)    Well, what's all this?  Oh, just some stuff I got out of my storage unit.  Check this out. You'll love this.  Do I look like a Terminator dog?  - No. - Yeah, I do.  Look I even brought Tom Sizemore's Game of Life.  \"Sell rights to Saving Private Ryan residuals  to buy a case of Coors Light.\"  \"Steal your son's wallet while he's in the shower.\"  \"Miss audition.\"  \"Scoop someone's urine from Starbucks toilet  to pass drug test.\"  Feels like we should be moving these pieces backwards.  (TECHNO BEAT PLAYING)  ANNOUNCER: Okay, let's make some noise  for Deejay Peter and the Sound Slap!  (CROWD CHEERING)  (ELECTRONIC EXPLOSION)  QUAGMIRE: Giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity,  giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity!  Give it to 'em.  PETER (OVER SPEAKERS): Shut up, Meg.  Sh-Sh-Shut up, Meg.  Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.  Butt scratcher!

I guess I do have a gift.  So are you in?  Yeah, that'd be amazing.  Can I kiss you?  - Excuse me? - I don't know.  Someone gave me a pill, and now all I want to do  is feel your jacket.  (MOANING): Oh, yeah.  No, no, stay here. Stay here.    That. That. That. See, listen. Right there.  You can't hear that on a CD.  Only the vinyl, man.  I'm glad we hung out after you struck out with my mom.  You know, I could've used some help folding these fitted sheets.  - Who's this turd? - Oh, this is Georgie.  Brian, I never said you could have guests.  Hey, don't touch that.  Okay, red flags flying.  Look, I need him out of here.  You can't kick him out. He's my friend, and I live here, too.  Not anymore. I want you out of my room.  Well, it's not your room anymore, it's our room.  Lois said so, and I'm not leaving.  I can't believe I ever wanted you here in the first place.  You're messy, you're loud, and thanks to you,  we've got a recurring flea problem.    Hey, Bri. You want to hang out?  Go away, Flea. You're not welcome here.  And put on a shirt. You're 50.  Actually, 54.    (SCRATCHING)  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Peter, I was plowing this college chick last night,  and I saw this flyer on her mini fridge.  I thought we were all in this together.  Well, yeah. That's the thing.  A guy on cocaine told me I'm the talent.  So what, you're just dropping us?  Yeah, how could you just ditch us?  All right, you know what? You guys were riding my coattails.  I carried you as long as I could,  but Rob Kardashian's gonna be at this thing,  so I got to be at my best.  Now, get out of here. I got to practice.    Damn it, Peter. That's too loud.  Turn it down.  That isn't loud. This is.  It's not loud until you can feel your head bones.  If you can't hack it, take a hike.  Why's he being such a jerk?  I don't know.  We've always had each other's backs,  like when we used to rob banks  in lesser-known presidents masks.  PETER: All right. Remember to tell everyone who did this.  Um. Who are you guys supposed to be?  PETER (SCOFFS): Oh, come on. I'm James K. Polk.  He's Millard Fillmore.  He's William Henry Harrison.  JOE: First president to die in office.  You should've been FDR.  Why?  'Cause of the you know.  The wheelchair doesn't define me!  CLEVELAND: And I'm Grover Cleveland.  It's funny, 'cause my name's Cleveland.  PETER: Aw, damn it, Cleveland. Now we got to kill them all.  (COCKS GUN) This guy gets it first.    (ALARM RINGING)  Ugh. Didn't you hear the alarm?  Peter, wake up.  We're gonna be late for church.  Are you even listening to me?  You've got to stop coming home so late  if you can't get up in the morning, and  (SPEAKING, NO SOUND)  (HEART BEATING)  (SILENCE CONTINUES EXCEP FOR HEART BEATING)  Oh, God. I can't hear Garfield.  I've gone deaf.    All right, now how long has your husband smelled like this?  Oh, no. That's just from riding here in a hot car,  but Dr. Hartman, what about his hearing?  Hearing?  This is a hospital, I'm not a lawyer.  Oh, for God's sake, is my husband deaf?  Well, there's only one way to find out definitively.  Hey stupid deaf guy!  Well, I've gotten the results back. He's deaf.  This is horrible.  This must be because of all that loud,  blaring music he's been playing in those nightclubs.  What's going on? Can he fix it in time  for me to deejay at the music festival?  - No. - What?  - No! - What?  Are you sure?  - Yes. - What?  (LAUGHING): Have a good life.    Hey, guys, I don't know if you've heard,  but I've gone deaf.  - You what? - What?  Oh, you're ear crippled?  I can't hear you, Joe.  Here's a bag of Alpha-Bits.  Please spell out what you're saying.  Oh, there's no \"L\" s.  By the way, I ate all the \"L\" s. They're delicious.  - They're my favorite ones. - What are you talking about?  - They all taste the same. - What?  Why don't you just text it to him?  You know, that's a good idea.  What the hell do you want?  You told us you were a big shot deejay  and didn't want anything to do with us.  (PHONE CHIMES)  I don't think he can hear it.  Oh, son of a bitch. Look at your phone.  Oh, what do I want?  Um, the Electric Clam Festival's coming up,  and I need your help.  Now that I'm deaf, I can't do it without you guys.  Forget it. You told us to go to hell.  Well, now you can go to hell.  Oh, great. Thanks.  I knew I could count on you guys.  - But we said no. - What?    One, two, thr ah, crap.  One, two come on.  All right. This time for the world record.  Eww. What the hell is that?  It's a ferret. Look at it, Brian.  It's like a long rat.  Like a living tail. Look at its feet.  Eww. They're gross. Why'd you get a ferret?  All the worst roommates have ferrets.  You want to pet it? It bites.  I can't sleep with that monster in here.  That's the idea. I want you out.  This room belongs to me and the ferret now.  Why you being such a dick about this?  Because. You're a pain in the ass to live with.  What did you just do?  I just pushed a little bitch baby.  (YELLING)  (BOTH GRUNTING)  Oh, Brian, there you are.  I wanted to tell you that you can come back  and sleep in our room.  What? I can?  Yeah. Turns out it was Peter  who was causing my allergies.  He stuffed all our pillows with hay  because he thought it looked comfortable in cartoons.  Wow. Then, I guess I'm moving out.  I guess you are.  (SIGHS) Look, Stewie, I-I  I probably got a little carried away.  I'm sorry I wasn't the best roommate.  Hey, Brian.  You know, maybe I wasn't such a great guy, either.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's okay.  You know, even if we were bad roommates,  we'll always be good friends.  I hope you and your ferret are happy in here together.  Well, now that you're moving out,  I'll probably just drown it in the tub.  (SCREAMS)  Brian! Brian! Ah!  It bit my nose. He's latching on.  Stop moving. I almost got him.  Fill the tub, fill the tub!    Hey, Stella, can I ask you something?  When you went deaf, did your other senses get better?  No. That's a common myth.  Chances are you'll be hit by a bus  in the first three months.  What?  Uh, damn it. Being deaf sucks.  I'd rather be stuck on a Disney cruise.  Ho-ho, ho-ho.  Don't eat the shrimp. Ho-ho.  (SIGHS) You know, the worst part of all of this  is I lost my friends.  I was a complete jerk to them.  I don't blame them for not wanting to help me.  What?  QUAGMIRE: We heard you, Peter.  Hey, Peter! We're over here.  You got to throw something at him.  Ow. Damn it.  What are you guys doing here?  (CHEERING)  All right, Peter, it's all cued up.  Just push this button.  Okay. Here we go.  No, Peter. Not that one.  NARRATOR (OVER COMPUTER): Audible dot com presents,  \"Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea,\"  as read by Chelsea Handler.  Peter, that's the wrong track.  Yeah, pretty good stuff, huh?  CHELSEA HANDLER: Chapter one. Stuff I can fit in my lady place.  Up first, Eiffel Tower Lego sculpture  Yep.  Peter, we got to stop this.  CHELSEA HANDLER: Soup thermos Yep.  It's locked.  Yeah. Awesome, huh?  Wait. How come everyone's leaving?  CHELSEA HANDLER: Brother brand, all-in-one fax, scanner, color copier  with phone attachment  (GROANING): Yep.    Well, bad news.  'Cause of that audiobook fiasco  I got fired from the club.  Hey, what's with your voice?  Did you get your hearing back?  Oh, yeah. Turns out it wasn't the loud music  at the clubs that made me go deaf.  It was the fistfuls of Oxycontin.  Well, that stinks about your deejay job.  Sorry it didn't work out for you.  That's okay.  I just appreciate that you guys  were there for me and tried to help me out.  Especially after I'd been such a jerk to you.  Well, it's good to have you back to normal, Peter.  Now, if you'll excuse me,  I'm up on Big Buck Hunter.  I get 'em? Oh, yeah. You got them all, Joe.  We didn't even put quarters in the game. He don't know.   (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Ugh. This is gonna suck.  80% of these acts are either air guitar  or girls dancing to songs from Frozen.  Yeah, back in my day you had to be a triple threat  to even get on that stage.  You were a triple threat?  I sure was.  I could sing, dance,  and guess the weight of any baby that was tossed to me.    I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy   Eight pounds!  Yankee Doodle do or die   12-nine! A big one!  A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam   Born on the Fourth of July   Three pounds? Someone couldn't wait to be here.    (SONG ENDS)  Did that really happen?  Nah, I just lip-synced \"Born to Run.\"  The show is about to start.  I-Is Daddy still parking the car?  Yes. Everything takes him longer these days.  His cataracts are getting worse.  Hey, Lois, look over there It's Jessica Chastain.  Oh, Daddy, that's Bryce Dallas Howard.  You're blind as a bat.    Okay, for the first of our 65 performances tonight  - WOMAN: You got to be kidding! - MAN: Son of a bitch!  I agree. Now please welcome Meg Griffin  and Ruth Cochammer. No laughing.  RUTH: It's \"Coke-a-mer\"!  Not in the boys' room it isn't.  (INTRO TO \"NUTHIN' BU A 'G' THANG\" PLAYING)  One, two, three and to the four   Meg Meggy Meg and Dr. Ruth is at the door   Wake up, people, Monsanto is poisoning the world  with frankenfoods, and we're letting it happen.  Monsanto equals murder!  - Monsanto equals murder! - That's enough.  I am so sick of this being used as a platform  to attack genetically modified foods.  You can't silence the truth!  What, what?  It's over, Patty.  PETER: Hi, Patty. I like Patty.  Okay, up next, here's Evelyn Fong,  our 11-year-old high school junior.  (APPLAUSE)  (PLAYING BEAUTIFUL, LILTING MELODY)  (MELODY ENDS)  Oh, my God.  What is that?  It's it's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.  It's a violin, Peter.  And now, two football players are going to do something  that only makes sense to the rest of the football team.  Coach, the bus is here.  This is an away game?  - (LAUGHTER) - It's true!  Remember that happened?  (CHUCKLES) Those are the kids I bought beer for.  - I got to take a leak. - Daddy, you can't see.  Let me help you to the bathroom.  I can see fine.  All right, there's only so many seats on the bus.  One of you will have to sit next to me.  I will, Coach.  (FOOTBALL PLAYERS LAUGHING)  PLAYER: Oh! He talked on the whole bus ride!  (PLAYER LAUGHING)  (URINATING) How are you, gentlemen  Dude! What the hell?  Whoa! With cataracts like those,  someone needs a big pair of glasses.  Hey! Jessica Chastain!  I'm glad you finally agreed to have  the cataract surgery, Daddy.  I wish I hadn't!  I can't see anything now! This is terrible!  Well, tha-that's why the whole family came to support you.  Oh, really? Oh, wow, that's so kind. Who's here?  Oh, uh, well, as you know, I'm here.  - Who else? - Uh, Stewie and Brian.  Hey, hope you feel better soon.  That doesn't sound like the whole family.  (LIKE PETER): Hey, hope those eyes get better soon, Pop.  It's me, Peter. Shipoopi.  Oh, thanks for coming, Peter.  (LIKE CHRIS): I-I'm here, too, Grandpa.  And, uh, and Meg went down to-to put money in the meter.  Aw, I don't care.  Now, Mr. Pewterschmidt, your vision will be impaired  for a few weeks while you recover.  I recommend you and your wife have someone around  to help you during this time.  Well, I'd love to help you, Daddy,  but Stewie's just been so fussy lately.  He's constantly crying for no reason.  What are you talking about? I'm fine.  Ow! Bitch!  She does this a lot!  You know, maybe Brian could help you.  He could be your service dog.  (QUIETLY): Come on, Lois, I don't want to do that.  Your father and I have nothing in common.  Brian, please. If you do this for me,  you'll be a hero just like King Arthur  when he pulled the sword from the stone.  (SUSTAINED FARTING)  (CONTINUES FARTING) Oh yeah!  Whew!  Oh, God, this is embarrassing.  (CONTINUES FARTING) I'm so sorry.  It's been, like, 500 years.  Aw, this is your big moment and I'm ruining it.  (PLAYING BADLY)  Peter, what the hell are you doing?  I'm learning violin. It's kind of like my new hobby.  Well, if we're talking about new hobbies  What is this? It's a Mason jar  filled with layered sand.  You can put it in your bathroom  or anywhere you want to feel peaceful.  Now it's nothing.  I always liked the violin,  'cause it kind of has curves like a lady.  Hey, you know what? Maybe you guys can learn an instrument, too,  and then we could all play together.  Really? That sounds like a lot of work.  Yeah, no offense, muchacho, but I don't know  if I have time for that, muchacho.  Yeah, you're doing \"muchacho\" wrong.  Come on, guys, it could be cool.  I did play the oboe in high school,  and the girls wouldn't leave me alone.  Girls do like guys in a band.  I'm in. Giggity.  (CHUCKLES): Oh, Quagmire, you are so predictable.  And that's why I love you, muchacho.  See? That's how you do \"muchacho.\"  And, you know, there's four of us  We could be a string quartet.  All right, I'll do it.  But first you guys got to do one thing for me.  Sure, Joe. What is it?  I want you to put me in the booth.  I want to feel like a person for a second.  Aw, yeah, sure, no problem.  All right, Quagmire, you do upper, I'll do lower?  Sure. Let's do it!  (STRAINED GRUNTING)  Wow. Thanks, guys.  Uh-oh.  (THUD) Hey, guys, guys, put him back up.  I just thought of something.  (LOWERING PITCH)  (THUD) (GIGGLES)  This is gonna be a blast.  Mr. Pewterschmidt, your service dog has arrived.  - Hey, Carter. - Brian!  Y-You have a butler? Then why am I here?  - Why can't he help you? - What? That's stupid.  Who would announce him?  See, this right here,  this is the one-percenter crap I can't stand.  Yes, it is. Now, sit your 99-percenter ass down  and read me the comics.  (GROANS)  Okay. The Wizard of Id is addressing his subjects.  - Is he up on that balcony? - Yes.  Ha-ha! Then it's a good one.  (PETER PLAYING OUT OF TUNE)  Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.  Peter, what note are you playing?  I-I'm sorry, I'm not familiar. Note?  Haven't you been practicing?  All right, fine, I haven't.  But I've been doing other violin stuff.  Like I bought this jacket like what Bugs Bunny wears  when he's with that opera guy.  Wow, that looks sharp.  Yeah, I've been practicing how to sit down in it.  Ew, Peter, those tails are soaking wet.  They may have been in the toilet.  Brian! Get in here!  Wh-What's up? What do you need?  I'm done with my bath. Put on this lady wig  - and help me out of the tub. - What? Why do I have to wear a wig?  Otherwise it's weird.  Thank you, Penelope.  Hey, it's 4:30 time for dinner.  But first, grab that Gold Bond and powder my speed bag.  Ah. There's the tingle.  Wow, so you can just bypass all that gridlock?  Having a helicopter's amazing!  And that's not all I also use it  to throw boxes of frogs down on that church.  (LAUGHS): They go bananas!  Boy, I could really get used to this rich guy stuff.  Funny, funny, funny what money can do   Them that have it   Get more of it   Less they need it   The more they love it   And it sticks to them   Like glue   Funny, funny, funny what money can do   Ask the rich man   He'll confess   Money can't buy   Happiness   Ask the poor man   He don't doubt   But he'd rather be miserable with than without   If you spend it   Please be wiser   If you save it   You're a miser   You don't want it   You're cuckoo   Funny, funny, funny what money can do   You guys, I got great news!  Some skank I used to bang is getting married,  and they need someone to play at the ceremony.  - We got our first gig! - Wow, a wedding that's awesome!  All right, then we should probably practice our piece.  (PLAYING \"WEDDING MARCH\" WITH PETER OUT OF TUNE)  Wait, hold on, hold on. Peter, uh, that's terrible.  You sounded like you were strangling a cat.  Well, I was that's how I got revved up to perform.  No, just now. Look, it's clear  that you still haven't practiced at all.  Yeah, this was your idea in the first place,  but you're the only one who's done no work.  No work? I stared in a mirror for hours  playing air violin to the song \"Bittersweet Symphony.\"  Peter, you're out of the group.  What?!  Well, fine. Screw you guys!  (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)  Wow, he seemed pretty angry.  Yeah, I haven't seen him this upset  since he got caught using that fake ID.  Can I see your ID, please?  Give me one second.  Uh, sir, that lady who came in and ate all the pies is back.  Okay, let's see how those eyes are doing.  See if you can tell me where Waldo is.  He's right there buying an ice cream cone.  Damn it! I've been stuck on that page for two days.  Oh, and your eyes are fine.  Hey, that's terrific, Carter!  Seems like it's time to go home  and pour some of that Scotch of yours to celebrate.  That sounds like a great idea.  See you later. Wait, wait, wait.  What are you talking about?  I meant, like like, both of us.  Didn't you hear him? I'm all healed.  I don't need a service dog anymore.  What are you saying?  I'm saying I'm done with you.  Now, before I go,  I'm just gonna old-man drink this glass of water.  (SIGHS)  (SIGHS)  (SIGHS)  Now, to take an old man pee.  (DOOR OPENS)  Ow. Ow. (SHORT SPLASHES)  Ow.  Ow. Ow.  Ow.  Ow. Ow. (SHORT SPLASHES CONTINUE)  Ow.  Ow. Ow.  Ow. Ow.  (SHORT SPLASH) Ow.  Oh, Brian, just in time for dinner.  We're having sloppy Joes.  Eh, what else you got?  How about a knuckle sandwich?  If Peter said that,  you all would've lost your minds laughing.  It's just that at Carter's house,  if you don't want something heavy,  Ãtienne will whip you up an egg dish with some shallots  and chanterelles or whatever's fresh.  Yeah, I know all about Ãtienne.  He climbed into my bed when I was 11.  I'm sure this is a step down for you, Bri,  but now you're back in the real world  where our poop stinks, and we all eat garbage.  Yeah, I guess I got used  to being a little pampered over at Carter's.  Well, I'd be careful with your uptown ways.  Some of the other kids don't like it.  (LOUD MUNCHING) (SNORTING)  He thinks he's better than us.  What time you going to bed, fancy boy?  I don't know. 9:00?  9:00, Chris.  Look, it's not even about the stuff.  Carter and I became friends.  Wait a minute! Of course!  Whatever you're going to say next, I bet it's wrong.  I offended Carter by offering to work for him.  I mean, once it became a friendship,  he didn't want me working for him.  He wanted a pal.  Brian, you're not kidding anyone.  We all know you don't care about Carter.  You only care about his money.  No, no, no. He knows I'm his friend.  Yeah, right. That's what Woody thought about Buzz Lightyear.  (GASPS) Bo Peep!  What-what's going on here?  Um you've got a friend in me?  What are you doing here?  I-I thought you were rehearsing with the guys.  Ah, the bastards kicked me out 'cause I'm not good enough.  Oh, and they also taught me  that if your hand is bigger than your face, you have cancer,  so maybe you should, uh, you know, do the test.  I had cancer, Peter. Remember?  I was in the hospital? You weren't there for it.  Well, maybe you have it again.  Peter, I'm not falling for your trick,  but if you're upset about the guys  kicking you out of the group, you can't really blame them.  The violin takes discipline and dedication.  You never even practiced.  They probably thought you were just wasting their time.  Maybe you're right. I guess  guess I could've been a little more serious about it.  Well, it's not too late.  Maybe you could find a teacher who could help you learn,  and if you work at it and get a little better,  they'll see you care about them.  You know what? That's a great idea!  I'll take some lessons.  I'm gonna work really hard just like my deodorant.  How does a guy like me stay fresh  I use Fat Guys Deodorant.  Whether you're sitting, leaning,  lying down or sitting, Fat Guys keeps ya dry.  Apply every five minutes, and you're good for five minutes.  And now for the confusing commercial backstory.  Ready for the fund-raiser, Dad?  Yeah, be right there, buddy.  We're going to a fund-raiser, and we share a bedroom.  Mr. Pewterschmidt, you have a visitor.  Hey, buddy, looking good!  So, what are we drinking?  Or better yet, why aren't we drinking?  Get the hell out of here!  I told you I'm done with you!  And besides, I'm off to the spa down at the club.  How's the temp? Good and hot?  Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.  Hey, did you also not wash your ass before getting in?  Yeah, (BLEEP) that sign.  - There you go, Mr. Glenn. - Thanks.  Hey, can I get a couple of extras of these plastic bags?  Let me just test this out quickly.  (INHALES DEEPLY)  Yeah, that works. Okay, now you go.  I have to get back to teaching violin lesson.  (PLAYING SCALES)  Those scales sound terrible!  You fat and lazy! You leave now!  No, please! I got to get better  so I can be as good as my friends.  I really let 'em down.  You fingers no bleeding.  You no try hard enough!  You want me press iron on your back again?  I'm trying! I'm trying!  Try harder! Play better!  (CRYING, PLAYING FASTER AND BETTER)  (SCREAMING)  Is somebody making a Cuban sandwich?  Lousy no-good rotten frassum-rassum  (MUTTERING GIBBERISH)  Brian, what's up?  Why are you engaging in cartoon profanity?  Carter wants nothing to do with me.  - I'm just so mad. - Don't you mean sad?  You know, about the friendship?  Oh, no, of course, you mean mad about the money.  All right, fine, it was about the money.  - I miss the money. - Yes, I know.  I saw all your Instagrams on his helicopter  like it was your helicopter.  I never said it was my helicopter.  Yeah, never said it wasn't.  The implication was that it was a regular part of your life.  Anyway, I know this makes me sound awful, but I almost wish  Carter was still blind so he'd still need me.  Yeah, but he's not.  But he could be.  But he isn't. But he should be.  Oh, no.  Come on, it'd be temporary,  just until he realizes I'm a great hang.  But you're not, so I don't want any part of this.  Okay. I get it. I get it.  Nah, you-you wouldn't want to help me.  What was I thinking? He he's your grandfather.  Even though he did say that thing about you.  What? What did he say about me?  Oh, I I'm sorry. I thought I told you.  Um, he said you couldn't cut it as a member of One Direction.  What?! But they have an opening!  Zayn is gone!  He does know Zayn is gone, right?  Oh, he definitely knows.  Yeah, he-he thinks you could be in O-Town,  but not One Direction.  Okay, I'm pretty sure you're manipulating me,  but let's go blind that old bastard.  Listen, Peter, we know you've been working hard on the violin,  but more importantly, you're our pal,  and we'd like you to be back in the group.  Really? What if I'm not good enough?  Well, that's the thing.  We decided we'd rather be lousy with you than great without you.  Joe, no offense, but I'd prefer to hear it from someone else.  - That's fair. - So, what do you say, Peter?  Will you come and play the wedding with us?  Oh, you bet I will! Oh, thanks!  You guys won't regret this, and don't you worry.  I'll be ready, unlike Lois getting dressed for a night out.  (GROANING) Tell them the truth!  It's me. It's me.  I'm the one who takes too long to get ready.  It's 'cause I don't have any nice clothes.  Peter!  All right. It's 'cause I don't like the way I look.  (WATER RUNNING)  Okay, Brian, Carter's in the shower.  As soon as he comes out, we spray this right in his eyes.  What'd you put in there again?  Oh, it's just tap water from Flint, Michigan.  And that's how the penis song goes.   Aah! Son of a bitch! My eyes!  (QUIETLY): You're up.  Carter, what happened?  You look like you could use some help.  Aah! My face! Aah!  (GROANING)  Oh, my God!  What did I let money do to me?  Who did this? Who are you?  Carter, it's me, Brian.  I did this, and it's made me realize  that I was blinded by luxury and comfort,  but now I see that none of that matters if I don't  Brian, Brian, hold on.    Looks like we've learned a lot, and my face is better.    (CROWD CHATTER, CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)  God, I'm so nervous.  You sure you guys want me to play with you?  Yes, Peter. You play away.  We're a quartet.  Just do the best you can.  You may kiss the bride.  (PLAYING \"WEDDING MARCH\")  (PLAYING A BEAUTIFUL SOLO)  (APPLAUSE)  Peter, that was amazing!  I know. Those lessons really paid off!  I'll say! The way you play,  we'll have more gigs than we can handle.  Not a chance. Mr. Washy Washy took all the joy out of this.  I hate the violin. I hate music.  I hate life, and I'm never doing this again!  All right, guys, let's go drink a bunch of free booze  and be a huge presence in the wedding photos.  Oh, what a night   Late December back in '63   What a very special time for me   As I remember, what a night   Oh, what a night         I got to say, some days I wish  I didn't have a sister.  Oh  - What? - Nothing.  Oh, I thought you asked me  what was going on with my sister.  I did not.  Hey, look. Tom Tucker.  Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.  Coming up, tonight's second story.  But first, Quahog says good-bye  to an old friend.  That's right, Tom. Medieval Castle,  which has been a staple of family entertainment and dining,  is closing its doors.  The restaurant has gone into foreclosure,  and will be up for auction tomorrow.  Yes, hard to believe a place where you eat with your hands  next to piles of horse dung  while untrained theater students fight  with real swords could be drowning in lawsuits.  Medieval Castle? I love that place.  My sister almost got a job there once.  Guys, we should go to that auction tomorrow and buy it.  I mean, can you imagine if we had our own medieval castle?  I bet it'd be even more fun  than when I went to White Castle.  Huh. Name's a little deceiving.  (GROANING)  What's wrong with you?  Oh, it's my back. It's killing me.  Yeah, I'm not falling for that hot-oil massage bit again.  No, this time it's not a bit.  I'm really hurt.  I must have jacked it up playing sports  and not trying to dance like BeyoncÃ©.  Wow. If you're in that much pain,  I better tell Lois.  (SCOFFS): Please don't.  Then she'll drive me to the doctor,  and I hate being in the car with her.  (\"EVERY MORNING\" PLAYING) BOTH:  Oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Oh, oh, oh   Shut the door, baby, don't say a word   Okay, I guess that's not my part.  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  There it is, guys. Aw, this is gonna be awesome!  We just got to win this auction,  and then we'll have our own castle.  Oh, yeah? Over my dead tooth!  Good afternoon, and welcome to today's auction.  I'm Al Harrington, of Al Harrington's  Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing  Tubeman Warehouse and Emporium.  Due to the presence of black mold,  discarded half-eaten turkey legs,  and an undulating rat king that no one dares approach,  I have been advised to move these proceedings along  as quickly as possible.  Do I hear an opening bid? Anyone.  Do I hear an opening bid for this majestic  fiberglass castle facade,  masking what was once a Midas Muffler shop?  Two bits.  Two bits. That's 25 cents in the Old West.  We have 25 cents. Do I hear higher than 25 cents?  This paper bag, which could be full of money or my socks.  You take the chance.  We have an intriguing mystery bag.  Do I hear more than the mystery bag?  Two bits and a cardboard box,  which may or may not contain a mystery bag.  Already the most challenging auction  I have ever been a part of.  Do I hear a higher bid  from that James Bond villain over there?  50 kroner.  Which, converted to American currency,  is $7.40.  Do I hear a much higher bid, followed by shocked murmuring?  $10,000! (ALL GASP)  - I'm shocked. - That's shocking.  We're all shocked.  We can't afford that.  Peter, do something. I can't.  There's only $9,000 in the mystery bag.  Due to my 12:00 noon court appointment  as part of a crippling child-custody battle  with my horrific ex-wife,  I am saying going once, going twice,  and awarding this condemned building to you!  (APPLAUSE)  Damn, it, we lost!  I guess the castle was a crazy idea anyway.  I should probably just invest this money  in a 401-Gay.  And how long before I can take this out?  Man, those losers don't deserve that castle.  I would call my sister about this  if she were able to answer the phone.  Poor thing.  Poor, poor thing.  Well, you know, in castle times,  if you wanted something, you just took it.  What are you talking about?  I'm saying the four of us should storm that castle  and take it for ourselves.  Should we do it with careful planning,  or have another couple beers and then just go for it?  Well, let's make that decision  after another couple beers.  I checked with my mom, and she said  it was cool with her if we wanted to sleep here tonight.  - I'm pretty sure I can. - Count me in.  I'm gonna have to go home and get my pillow.  (ALL SHOUTING)  Yes, you heard me right, cancel my insurance.  I've been in this location for 40 years,  and never once have I broken a lamp.  Good day, sir.  God, I hope he's got insurance.  Of course he's got insurance.  He's been at this location for 40 years.  Yes, you heard me right.  Cancel my husband's life insurance.  He's been in perfect health for 40 years.  We're selling the lamp store and going to travel.  We need this after losing both our children.  Good day, sir.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  All right, plan \"B.\"  We'll shoot flaming arrows, like in Robin Hood.  So should I be aiming for an open window,  or just arcing it over the wall?  I don't know, I've never seen the movie,  just the Bryan Adams video.  Oh, such a good song.  Archers  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, he's that guy, too.  Prepare to fire.  (SIRENS BLARING)  I wonder what they're gonna put here.  Trader Joe's?  Oh, I would love a Trader Joe's!  Sorry to keep you, I was reading this  Highlights magazine in the waiting room.  Do you see any differences between these two pictures?  Oh, the pie has a wedge removed.  Yes, yes.  Dr. Hartman, were you able to tell anything  from Stewie's X rays?  Oh, yeah. Little guy's got scoliosis.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, am I gonna be a big-shoe, small-shoe guy?  But don't worry, he'll be fine.  He just needs to wear this brace for a while  - to correct it. - Oh, dear.  Now, does he have any school pictures coming up?  Yeah, he actually does.  Well, then, this will not be  a \"refrigerator door\" year.  All right, this says if we don't get arrested  for the next six months,  the arson and mayhem charges will be dropped.  Hey, sorry again, you guys.  Ah, no harm done.  Yeah, no hard feelings, fellas.  I've already forgotten about it.  I'm too busy thinking about my hot date tonight.  Yeah, right. \"Hot date.\"  With your left hand or your right hand?  Actually, I use both and do, like, an Indian burn.  But that's not what this is.  Tonight I'm getting lucky.  Hi, are you Mort?  Why, yes, I am.  What the hell was that? Mort's getting laid?  Yeah, thanks to Tinder, he's had a different girl  every night this week.  What's \"Tinder\"?  It's an app for your phone  where two strangers can hook up  for a dirty liaison.  - What, like hookers? - Nope.  Just two horny people with phones.  Wait, I don't get it.  So you hit 'em on the head with your phone and knock 'em out?  No, you just swipe someone's picture, they come over, and you plow 'em.  Wow! I gotta try this.  I mean, easy sex on the Internet?  Did you know about this, Scott Baio?  Uh, yeah.  And you, Scott Caan?  Did you also know about easy sex on the Internet?  Yes.  And how about you, douche bag music producer Scott Storch?  Quagmire, all the Scotts know about it.  Okay, let's get me set up on this Tinder thing.  I can't wait to start getting laid  at the push of a button.  Well, first you got to set up your profile.  Oh, yeah, I've been working on that. I wrote several long paragraphs  describing my interests, some pet peeves,  choice of wine, a couple of inspirational quotes,  things I've learned from my cats  No, no, no, no. None of that.  You want a naked bathroom selfie  covering your stuff with a fistful of $100 bills.  That shows you like sex, and you got mon-ay!  Well, that seems a bit crude.  - (PHONE CHIMES) - Oh, she's cute.  And wearing a yin-yang necklace.  That's interesting. I wonder what beach that is.  No, no, no. Give me that.  Here, you see this? You see what I'm doing?  Not even looking. I'm swiping \"yes.\"  Yes, yes, yes. Casting a wide net.  - (PHONE CHIMES) - Heh, look at this.  You already got a hit. And she sent a message.  She did? What am I looking at here?  It's mostly small, colorful pictures.  Those are emojis. Read 'em.  Okay, it says \"Hey,\" and then a kissy face,  and then, like, a saucy, smirking face,  three balloons, and a locomotive.  What the hell is all this?  Maybe she likes you. Send something back.  Okay. \"Dearest Theresa, I hope this finds you well.  I so appreciated your last communication\"  No, stop, stop! God, stop, stop!  Just send her an eggplant and the erupting volcano.  (BRACE SQUEAKING)  All right, take a gander.  Gawk at the Elephant Man. Let's get it all out.  - There's our brave guy. - Brave?  And just for being such a trooper,  I thought maybe you could be  the first in line for snack today.  Really? On pretzel day?  And after that, you can hold the bunny!  Yeah, I'll pass on that.  But the pretzel thing sounds up my alley.  Now, if I could just find someone  to wear this hero hat.  (GASPS) I think I found him.  Well, I say, that was a pleasant surprise.  You know, like when a woman in a Porsche Cayenne  isn't a complete bitch.  Huh. Well, I did not expect that.  (TIRES SCREECH)  I wasn't telling you to go,  I was trying to smell my own fart.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Hi, are you Courtney, from Tinder?  You must be Glenn. I got you these.  A lovely bouquet for a lovely  Yeah, take off your pants and sit on the coffee table.  Okay.  (DOOR CLOSES)  That was great.  And we can still make our reservation.  What? Why?  - We already had sex. - Wait.  So I don't have to make small-talk with you  - or spend any money? - Of course not.  Here, wipe yourself off with this West Elm catalog.  My God, this app is amazing!  Thank you, cell-phone Jesus.  Huh?  Oh, yeah, fine.  (\"FUN\" BY PITBULL FEATURING CHRIS BROWN PLAYING)  Oh, feeling crazy   The moon is up   The night is hazy   Let's got lost in the shadows   Somewhere we can go   And no one else can find   Loosen up your body till you come undone   Loosen up your body, baby, come undone   Oh, my, my, looking like a good, good time   Don't disguise   The way you wanna love tonight   Oh, my, my, hook you with a brand-new high   Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight   Live a little  F.U.N.   So, how's it going with the back brace?  - Are people giving you a hard time? - Quite the contrary, Brian.  Apparently, people love the wretched.  Thanks to this thing, I was offered seats  directly behind home plate at Fenway.  I passed.  Wow, that patient next door (LAUGHING) is fat.  PATIENT: I can hear you.  Uh, that wasn't me, that was Mrs. Griffin.  So, I've got Stewie's results here.  Um, it appears the back brace  has corrected the spine very nicely.  That's wonderful.  Stewie doesn't have to wear the brace anymore.  What? No!

He may have a concussion.  A concussion?  You do me an honor, Lieutenant,  but my dance card is full.  Officer Swanson, as you requested,  here's a big stack of all the cases you cracked.  Oh, great. Now I'm gonna go ahead and brood over a photo  of the girl whose case was the one I couldn't solve.  Your '70s sweater and feathered hair let people know  this is a cold case.  PETER: Well, hello, Officer Swanson.  Peter? What are you doing?  You're not supposed to be here.  I saw you on TV, hogging all the credit for my police work.  Look, I told you, I need you to be a silent partner on this.  The truth is I could get in a lot of trouble.  Oh, I see. You need me to be the bad cop who kicks all the ass  and then I'm supposed to be quiet about it?  Well, my silence is gonna cost you.  What are you saying?  I'm saying you get stuff, I want stuff.  I've seen that evidence locker.  I know you got Discmans in there.  I want a murdered jogger's Discman.  Peter, you know I can't do that.  Yeah? Well, maybe I accidentally reveal  that you're not the hero everyone thinks you are  and that you've been letting your neighbor  do all kinds of cop stuff.  You wouldn't do that, would you?  You bet I would.  And one more thing.  Peter asked me to do this.  He, he said it's something from before.  I, I don't know, I I hope it's funny.  All right, I'm here. But why did you want me to bring this?  I'll tell you why. You're getting all the credit  for my police work, so I want stuff from you.  I want a minute in your house with this shopping cart,  like Supermarket Sweep.  Here, time me.  Peter, you expect me to let you ransack my house?  Well, unless you'd rather I spill the beans to the chief  about who's been doing your dirty work.  Okay, go.  [cabinets opening.]  Aw, sweet, board games!  I'm taking the cannon from your Monopoly!  [Bonnie screams.] Why is Peter in the house?  It's a police matter, Bonnie!  PETER: Hey, how come Kevin's room is locked?  He just wants some privacy!  It's locked from the outside!  Don't open it, Peter!  [door opens, crashing.]  Hi, baby. Hi, baby.  Get out of Susie's room!  [crashing.]  Your stuff sucks. I didn't need the full minute.  Hey, Stewie, how's our little concussion guy?  Oh, my God. Can you, can you see me?  Yeah, I know, I'm fine, I'm fine.  I-Is anybody gonna answer that telephone?  He keeps thinking the phone is ringing, Brian.  Well, at least he's talking again.  I think that means he's getting better.  Is it day or night?  I don't, I don't care, I just want to know.  Lois, answer the bloody phone!  N-No, no! W-we don't need Lois. [chuckles.]  Chris, pretend to answer the phone.  Oh, uh, hello?  Okay. Yes, one second.  Mom, it's for you!  What? No! Damn it, Chris!  Um, um I'll, I'll take that.  Hello, this is Brian Griffin.  Actually, I already receive The New York Times,  and I always enjoy finishing the crossword puzzle.  You're bragging to nobody?  Phone's still ringing.  Crap, Chris, he's worse off than I thought.  We have to do something.  Well, on TV if somebody gets hit on the head,  you hit them a second time and that gets them back to normal.  No, no, Chris. This is very serious.  You see, what a concussion is is the impact of brain matter  on the inside of the skull.  That's why you sometimes hear this nonsense about,  \"Oh, let's just give them better helmets.\"  But you can't make a helmet for the inside  Chris, are you crazy?  Shh. Let's just let him sleep this off.  Look how peaceful he is.  I wonder what's going on in that little head of his.  The world looks mighty good to me   'Cause Tootsie Rolls are all I see   Whatever it is I think I see   Becomes a Tootsie Roll to me!   Joe, is something wrong?  I didn't hear you crying in the shower this morning.  I'm just dealing with some stuff at work.  But everything's going so well.  You've been getting all those commendations  and my online handmade lip balm business is really taking off.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  Well, I'm proud of you.  And you should be proud of yourself.  I want these: rechargeable heated mittens.  Write it down.  Forget it, Peter.  I'm done being blackmailed by you.  Oh, yeah?  Well, fine, but remember,  you're nothing without your muscle.  DISPATCHER: Any available unit,  we have a report of an armed robbery in progress.  Go on, hero cop. You don't need me.  Well, uh, maybe you and I could do one last bust  for old time's sake.  Yes! All right, let's do it. Let's go be heroes.  Like the designated Shriver.  Is there a skeleton with a wig that can drive me home?  I can.  Look at this mess!  Where is the housekeeper?  Well, you already look better.  The doctor should be in any minute.  [baby crying.]  Chris, what the hell?  There is a room where you can go in and just get free people.  Yeah, you should give that back.  Look, I'm really sorry I let you get hurt, Stewie.  I never should've pushed you into that game.  Oh, it's not your fault.  I just have to accept that I'm not a man  and I'm never going to be one.  That's ridiculous. You can't let  what one woman says in a grocery store define who you are.  Mom and Dad said it, too.  I heard it through a vent in the wall.  Hey, knock, knock.  Coach Herrera?  You came to see Stewie?  Yeah, I wanted to check in on this tough little guy.  \"Tough little guy\"?  It takes a real man to take a hit like that.  Feel better, sport.  How about that?  \"Real man.\"  See? I told you, Stewie.  You're a big, tough boy.  Yes, I guess I am.  That may be, Stewie.  But if I were you, I'd stay off the field.  Concussions are the number one problem in football today.  Recent brain scan studies have shown  [band music playing.]  that brain injuries are directly linked to dementia  and suicides in former players!  - [music gets louder.] - Yet the league  You can play the music louder but you can't silence the truth!  [siren wailing, tires screeching.]  Peter, slow down!  No can do, Joe. I'm all hopped up  'cause I Vicks Vapo'd my sack.  [tires screeching.]  I also got some of it in my eyes.  Am I getting them? Am I getting the robbers?  Peter, put the gun down!  On the floor, punks.  Everybody dies.  [screams.]  My already-irritated eyes!  Aw, damn it, Peter!  This is Officer Swanson, I need backup at  PETER: Ow! They're beating me with vaping accessories!  Forget it, there's no time.  Freeze, police!  Too late, Joe. I already identify with my captors.  Don't hurt Max and Ken.  [gunshots.]  Holy crap, Joe. That was freaking amazing!  You kicked their ass!  You're right, I guess I did.  And without my help.  See, this is the Joe I remember.  You know, maybe you had it in you all along.  Wow. I guess I just got ground down by years  of people treating me like an errand boy,  and I just let them walk all over me.  You know, you were a real pain in the butt as a partner,  but you helped me find myself again.  Thanks, Peter.  You're welcome, Joe.  Excuse me, do you have any Tab soda I can bring back  to the sex dungeon where I've been held captive for decades?  Ma'am, this is a crime scene.  I'm gonna have to ask you to move along.  You're right, Peter. I'm a pretty good cop.   TV ANNOUNCER: Is Netflix Streaming  the right choice for you?  Well, if you like movies in HD,  then frozen pixels, then HD again,  the answer is \"yes.\"  And if you love the golden year of movies, 2003,  then we might have some of what you're looking for.  Netflix Streaming: buffer for 20 minutes,  then watch 35 minutes of a movie with Jason Statham.  Oh, look what came,  the free DVD from my PBS pledge.  Whatever it is, we're not watching it.  Peter, trust me,  you of all people could really learn something from this.  It's a documentary about the food industry called,  Food Kills.  Huh. Says here that Colon Health Magazine  gave it two thumbs in.  (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYS)  Hi, I'm Matt Lauer's cousin, Stephen McCormick.  Our moms are sisters.  America is gorging itself on processed food,  creating an obesity epidemic.  We've abandoned natural foods  for chemicals, additives and refined sugars.  At this rate, this is what the future will look like.  Those are flying cars,  but the people in them are too fat.  Oh, no, I left my baby in there.  Without drastic changes in our diet,  Americans are headed for a health catastrophe.  For more, go to our website at  \"double-u double-u double-u dot PBS dot com.\"  That's \"www\" dot,  the word \"double-u\" three times,  the word \"dot,\" \"PBS,\"  the word \"dot\" again,  the word \"com,\" dot com.  There was a miscommunication when we registered our website.  Well, that's it, from now on,  we're eating healthy around here.  We're gonna feel better and we're gonna look better.  Well, looking better doesn't always solve your problems, Lois.  It sure didn't work for Droopy Dog when he got that facelift.  Contrary to my appearance, I'm still not happy.  Please study my brain so that others don't suffer as I have.  (SAD TRUMPET MELODY)  Thanks for coming to my birthday party, you guys.  And Esther, I'm so sorry you ripped your perineum  doing the Hokey Pokey.  That's okay, I got free curly fries.  Okay, let's see what Meg got me.  A crock pot?  Things about to get crazy!  You can cook a pork tenderloin under your bed.  Excuse me, girls.  We're about to start roller derby in a minute.  Wait, wait.  You. What's your name?  Me? Meg Griffin.  Would you mind standing up?  Whoa! What-what-what are you doing?  My God.  The magic ratio.  What's that?  It means your ankles, calves, and thighs  are all the same thickness.  How would you like to try out for the roller derby team?  Really?  - Do it, Meg. - Yeah, Meg. You should totally do it.  Meg's talking to a boy!  Okay, sure. What the heck?  Here. Take my card.  \"I am a registered sex offender.\"  Flip it over.  \"IMPORTANT: see other side.\"  Give me that.  I'm the roller derby coach.  See you at tryouts.  I can't believe it, you guys.  This is the biggest surprise  since the last M. Night Shyamalan movie.  Two tickets for the M. Night Shyamalan movie.  Wow. Really?  Hope you guys are ready for a healthy dinner.  I went to Whole Foods today and got this recipe  from an extremely thin man with a giant Adam's apple.  I hate that place.  None of the cereals are advertised on TV.  What's this stuff that looks like sand?  It's quinoa.  Nope, I don't eat foods that sound like karate words.  Well, according to Food Kills, quinoa is a superfood.  It's very nutritious, and it even helps keep you regular.  Lois, I have a system  I poop once a week for an hour and a half.  I wear a headband and it's soaked when I'm all done.  Mm.  Wow, Lois, you know, this is actually pretty good.  Peter, you should try it.  Ugh. Fine.  (GAGGING)  Peter, knock it off.  I can't help it!  My body's rejecting it!  (DANCE MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND) Name?  Quinoa.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry, sir, we're full.  Come on in, gummy bears!  Oh, you are looking fine tonight.  Mm!  Thanks again for coming and supporting me, Chris.  No problem. And I'm gonna take some pictures  of the other athletes, if you don't mind.  You might not know this about me,  but I am a bit of a shutterbug.  Okay, that's-that's all okay.  All right, ladies, line up.  How about we start with some warm-ups?  Bend down and touch your toes.  (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING RAPIDLY)  CHRIS: \"Memory card full\"?  Come on!  Okay, now, last year we were tricked  by a couch on a dolly with wheels,  so if any of you is a couch on a dolly with wheels,  I'm gonna ask you to please leave now.  Well, we need five for a team  and there's five of you here,  so congratulations.  Wow! This is awesome!  I can't believe I'm a Quahog Thug!  When do we start skating?  Here, look at the schedule.  This is just a list of Sexaholic Anonymous meetings.  Flip it over.  It says, \"Remember to attend your meetings.\"  I'm gonna stop handing you stuff.  (GROANING)  It's the middle of the night.  Where are you going?  I'm sick of all this healthy crap.  I'm going downstairs to find something good to eat.  And then I'm gonna fall asleep watching transvaginal mesh  lawsuit commercials.  There's nothing.  Thank you, son.  What's going on, man, are you pregnant?  No, my wife watched that food documentary.  And you should never ask that unless you're sure, by the way.  Aw, yeah, peanut-butter-cup- Dorito-sausage-car panini.  And let's crack a Cadbury Egg over the whole thing.  (SIZZLING) Just gonna use my spare glove-compartment-underwear  as a napkin.  I can't believe Randy Quaid gets to eat like this every day.  Peter? Is that you?  Cleveland?  Are you cooking in your car?  I am.  Is this because of Food Kills?  Oh, you saw that movie too, huh?  We watched Tyler Perry's Food Kills,  which is the same movie except it stars  black folks you've never heard of  and white folks you don't hear from anymore.  But, yeah, now Donna is forcing me to eat healthy.  I always get confused, is Donna the wife,  or is Roberta the wife?  I don't know, man, can I have some of that sandwich?  Oh, our hands just touched.  Mm.  Wow, Peter. That's good.  That's real good.  I'm not sure what we're doing now.  MAN: Excuse me,  whatever you've got in there smells incredible.  Man, my wife won't let me eat any of that stuff.  Tell you what, I'll give you ten bucks for that thing.  Yeah, me, too.  Wow.  Huh, if I sell two sandwiches for $10 each,  that equals  (WOMAN VOCALIZING)  money.  Peter, you just made $20 from two sandwiches.  Wow, you're right.  Hey, maybe I could turn this into a business.  You know, selling sandwiches from a car.  Wonder how much I could make.  (WOMAN VOCALIZING)  Mad world   Whoops, I stopped thinking about math  and started thinking about baby-man Billy Corgan  being sad at Disneyland.  (PETER'S LAUGH TO MELODY OF \"LA CUCARACHA\")  Peter, what the hell is this?  This, Lois, is my new food truck,  specializing in all the delicious, unhealthy foods  that you won't let me eat.  'Cause you don't let me eat what I want to eat  and that and, uh, I am super dizzy  and there might be a gas leak in this thing.  (PETER'S LAUGH TO MELODY OF \"DIXIE\")  I can't believe you'd buy a food truck.  What are you even selling?  First of all, believe it, baby.  Second, uh, mostly hamburgers where the buns is jelly donuts.  And drinks where hot dogs is the straws.  (SLURPING) Mm.  Another milkshake, please.  Look, I'm happy for the business,  but drinking that on your knees is  it's putting a hat on a hat.  Look at this food. It's gross and unhealthy.  It's exactly the stuff I'm trying to get you not to eat.  Yeah, but people like this food. It makes them happy.  I mean, you can eat sprouts and vegan crap your entire life  and still get devoured by Gremlins  and-and-and none of it matters.  So you're saying you shouldn't take care of yourself  because you might get devoured by Gremlins?  Get a clue, mama.  Think of what you're doing to your body, Peter.  Oh, there we go.  You think I'm overweight.  I know you're overweight.  Hey, yeah, I'll have the, uh, Swedish Fish Tacos.  You want the can of chili dumped on top or on the side?  What does the chef recommend?  Me? I like to squeeze the can so hard  the chili flies into my mouth like Popeye.  Do it up.  You got it. Let me put on my bandana,  fire up my very loud \"what\" generator, and get cooking.  (GENERATOR RUNNING LOUDLY)  Peter, this isn't over!  What?!  Ladies and gentlemen,  welcome to the first bout of the season,  the Quahog Thugs versus the Medford Dump Cakes.  This season we're brought to you by Barry's Note Cards.  \"When you need to remind yourself of the sponsor,  use Barry's Note Cards.\"  (WHISTLE BLOWS)  (MEG GASPS)  (MEG GRUNTING)  Nice move, Griffin.  Way to go, Meg!  ANNOUNCER: Wow, newcomer Meg Griffin  is lighting up the track with some amazing moves.  \"Amazing\"? Damn right, amazing.  Make some noise  if you're mixing prescription drugs with alcohol!  (CHEERING)  Wow. This is a lot more physical than I thought.  My favorite part of a woman's body is haunches.  And this is all haunch, baby.  (GRUNTS)  Meg!  Boy, that was rough.  This sport's even more dangerous than skeet shooting.  Pull!  I got in the wrong line!  That'll be $16.  $16? That's expensive.  Yes, sir. Everything's very expensive  because you're paying for it on an iPad.  Now, if you'll just select a gratuity.  Options are 60%, 90%, and 200%.  Uh, I guess 60%.  Okay, great.  And just sign by dragging your bare finger  across this thing I use to masturbate.  Uh, okay.  Thank you, please make sure  to bang your head on that low-hanging thing.  What are you (SHOUTS)  Oh, you spilled something. You want a napkin?  Yes, please.  All right, here's 40, blown by the wind.  (PANTING)  Oh, Chris, I'm glad you're here.  Swing that lamp at me.  But you'll get hurt.  No, I won't.  I'm gonna dodge it.  (SHOUTS)  Oh, my God, are you okay?  Yeah, I'm fine.  This roller derby's really toughened me up.  I got to say, I've-I've never felt better.  Really?  'Cause I watched how rough it was out there the other day,  and I got a little worried for you.  I mean, all it would take is one bad hit  to do permanent damage.  I think you should quit.  What? No.  No, I-I love roller derby.  It's the first thing I'm really good at.  Plus, I love making other women bleed.  But you know, in ways besides the way,  you know, they normally bleed.  STEWIE: She means periods.  Yeah, I got it, Stewie, but I'm telling you, Meg,  something bad is going to happen.  Like when you give a young athlete too much money.  I, I got to murder somebody.  Peter, kids, dinner!  Kids? Peter?  It's time for a healthy, veggie dinner!  Come on, I spent the whole day  making the house smell like farts.  Where the hell is everybody?  All right, I got a bowl of cereal  that's M&M's and Dr. Pepper?  Over here.  Chris, put that down.  You kids get in the house  and eat the healthy dinner I prepared,  and Peter, you, too.  Shut down that truck and get inside.  Lois, I already told you.  I don't want to eat your garbage food. All right?  Now can you go inside and get me some Pop Rocks?  I'm making a paella.  You know what? Enough of this nonsense.  You love this truck so much, stay in it,  'cause I don't want you or your food in the house.  Fine. I love this truck.  I got everything I need in here.  Maybe I'll just live here.  I can imagine it now.  (WOMAN VOCALIZING)  Living in America   Whoops. I stopped thinking about the truck  and started thinking about Amazon woman  Brigitte Nielsen drunk in a Burbank park.  (BIRDS SINGING)  (SNORING)  (ALARM BEEPING)  All right, time to greet the day.  Are you living in a truck?  Not bad. I see you got a Hooters calendar in here.  How do you get anything done  with those rocking knockers staring at you?  Hey, who says I get anything done?  Guy talk, guy talk. Yeah, guy talk.  (CHUCKLES) Guy talk. This is how guys talk.  Oh, Peter, this is awful.  Well, I love it.  And I'm not going back in that house  and listen to Lois tell me how fat and unhealthy I am.  You do look like you've put on a few.  Your elbows are starting to pucker.  Yeah, I mean, are you really happy in here?  You bet I am.  I'm happier than a squash on Halloween.  Dad, are they coming to take us away, too?  No, son, we're fine.  How about on Thanksgiving?  You know what, just enjoy the month.  (GRUNTING)  You're going down, Griffin, like my stepfather's pants!  I guess I see where some of your anger comes from.  (GRUNTS)  Oh, no. This is bad.  That's it. I have to do something.  Chris, what are you doing?  Saving my (SHOUTS)  (GROANING)  Oh, my God. Chris, are you okay?  I don't think so. I'm hurt pretty bad,  like that time I was running with scissors.  (LAUGHING)  You run like a girl.  Run like a man, you get a suit.  Here you go. And if you'd like to put your e-mail  on our sign-up list,  I'd be happy to sell it to Russian hackers.  Peter, Peter, it's happening.  What? The Bing Maps car.  It's three blocks down and it's coming this way.  Holy crap. This is the day we've been waiting for.  We said we're gonna stand in our front yards  and wave as it goes by so we're on the street view.  We're gonna be on the Internet.  Mort just called. It went by his house.  Everybody, places! Start waving.  This is not a drill!  (GRUNTS)  Damn it. I can't fit through the door.  I'm stuck in the truck.  - What? What are you talking about? - (GRUNTING)  I knew this would happen. You're too fat to get out.  I see it. I see the Bing car.  Oh, my God, Bing! Bing! Over here! Bing!  They can't see you, Peter.  You're facing away from the street.  Stop talking, Quagmire. Just smile.  This is amazing.  Crap. Is it gone?  The driver nodded at me.  I I think I'm gonna cry.  Damn it. I can't believe I missed it.  Jeez, I hope I don't end up stuck in here  like Winnie the Pooh.  Uh, Rabbit?  Perhaps you should push with your shoulder and not your fist?  RABBIT: Don't worry about it.  Hey, did that big \"boomba boomba\" nurse come in here?  Uh, no.  But Dr. Hartman, is my brother gonna be okay?  (WHISPERING): That's her. That's her.  (VOICE BREAKING): Hi, Juanita.  Hello, Doctor.  Was that weird? Was I just weird?  Kind of.  You don't know. I was fine.  Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry you got hurt like this.  Roller derby was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I finally felt like I was good at something, I made friends  but seeing you like this, I realize you were right.  It's too dangerous. So I'm going to quit.  No, Meg. I got hurt because I didn't belong out there,  but you do.  I watched you skate.  You found your calling and I believe in you.  Now get back to that rink and help your team  win the championship it deserves.  Really? I will. Thanks, Chris.  MORGAN FREEMAN: With the spirit in her heart renewed,  Meg returned to the roller derby arena.  I think she did all right,  but no one will know for sure because halfway through  everyone stopped to watch some fat kid  who was killing it on Dance Dance Revolution.  (CHUCKLES)  Dance, you fat bitch.  So tonight, we say to the yellow-billed marsh finch  you're extinct.  But, right now, we're getting word of breaking news.  We go live to Tricia Takanawa with details.  - Tricia? - Tom, I'm standing here  outside a Spooner Street home,  where a local business owner has apparently eaten himself  into his own food truck.  Oh. It appears they've finally removed the roof.  Nobody look. This is a private, gross matter.  Mr. Griffin, is this performance art  or, uh, some sort of political statement?  Well, I'm kind of ticked about condoms in porn,  but this is unrelated.  Oh, hey, Lois. I guess you must be happy.  Yeah, it's every girl's dream to have her husband hoisted  out of a food truck in a horse harness.  No, look, I-I'm just saying, you were right.  I'm a big tub of lard,  and you have every reason to be ashamed of me.  Ashamed of you?  I-Is that really what you think?  Well, yeah, you kept saying how overweight I am.  Peter, don't you get it?  I only wanted you to eat healthy because I love you,  and I'm concerned about your health.  I want you around for as long as I'm around.  Really? Well, I love you, too, Lois.  I'm sorry I was such a jerk.  I guess I could do without eating so much junk,  but I could never do without you.  Oh, Peter.  Ma'am, please step back.  We have to wash him with a hose.  Guys, look! Look! The Bing car is back.  No. I'm not ready! I'm not ready!  MORGAN FREEMAN: Inspired by his love for Lois,  Peter had steamed vegetables and brown rice that evening,  then ate like crap for the rest of his life.  Nonetheless, he was immortalized on Bing Maps.  (LAUGHS)  Fat people are amusing to me.  Hang there, you fat bitch.   Hey, guys, I didn't know you were coming to the church raffle.  I will confess a mix-up to you.  I thought Donna said we were going to the \"church waffle.\"  And we're only here for the fantasy weekend at Fenway Park.  Fenway Park?  Oh, yeah, the winner and a friend get to hang out  and practice with retired Red Sox players  and then play in a real game, right on the field at Fenway.  Oh, my God, that's always been a dream of mine!  Well, that and tuning a guitar in front of a live audience.  (GUITAR TUNING)  (STRUMS DISCORDANT NOTES)  This was in perfect tune when they handed it to me.  Next up, our fantasy weekend for two at Fenway Park.  Oh, man, this is it!  And the winner is  Peter Griffin!  Holy crap, I won!  - Wow, good for you! - Congratulations!  I like it when people say your name out loud!  How exciting, Peter.  A weekend trip to Boston.  Yeah, and the best part is,  I don't even have to get on a plane.  I always have trouble at the airport.  Sir, you're not allowed to be on the carousel.  Well, then maybe you shouldn't have named it such a fun word.  Uh, excuse me, excuse me, I'm not yours.  He's stealing me! I'm being stolen!  Excuse me, I think you've got mine.  Oh, that's a good idea.  (KNOCKS ON DOOR)  - Oh, hey, Quagmire. - Hey, Peter.  So I was just baking a coffee cake,  and I figured I'd bring it over,  'cause you like coffee cake.  Wow, thanks.  Yeah, yeah, no problem.  - So, who are you taking to Fenway? - What?  Well, I was just thinking, you have that extra ticket,  - maybe you'd want to - Peter, before you answer him,  I've got that murdered jogger's Discman you wanted last week.  Still bloody.  Hi, Peter. You know how you like $40 cash?  Well, here's almost $40 cash.  Guys, look, I know you all want to go,  but I-I need a little more time to figure this out.  I mean, it's a tough decision.  Like what to do with that big watermelon I bought.  Griffin, I just wanted to tell you  that's a great outfit.  Keep it up.  I knew it.  I have to start trusting myself more.  Man, I don't envy you.  Whichever one of them you bring to Fenway,  the other two will be mad at you.  I don't want to bring any of them.  Those guys are all way better than me at baseball.  They'd just show me up and ruin it for me.  Why don't you bring Lois?  She doesn't care about baseball,  and that way nobody gets their feelings hurt.  Brian, that's a great idea.  Thanks.  -

I was just trying to play hard, like Pete Rose.  Look, I can even do the Pete Rose haircut.  I bet you a thousand bucks I have a drinking problem.  Guys, we got to get that leg set.  I guess I should ride in the ambulance.  You think I'll be back in time for the game?  What? You're not playing in the game.  It's supposed to be a fun day out here,  and you go nuts and break your wife's leg.  It's not my fault, I'm all hopped up  on hard baseball card gum.  Mmm, it's like eating a MasterCard.  Let's get her out of here.  And you, you're done.  Clean out your locker!  Kicked out? I'm totally screwed.  Like those poor guys who had to come up  with a new ad campaign for Subway.  Hey, I'm Mike.  I like sandwiches and people my own age.  ANNOUNCER: Subway please don't think of pedophilia.  You know what I'm getting sick of saying?  \"My husband did this to me, but it's not what you think.\"  Please forgive me, Lois. I'm so stupid.  The reason I didn't bring my friends is  'cause I didn't want 'em hogging the spotlight.  And then when I saw everyone giving you all that attention,  I-I guess I kind of lost it.  You did a little.  But of course I forgive you.  I just don't understand why you went so crazy.  Well, ever since I was little,  I was always the fat, uncoordinated kid  that nobody wanted on their team.  And I was excited that for one weekend,  if I could just step on that field  and get a hit at Fenway Park,  I could erase all that and feel like a champ  for the first time in my life.  But I'm not a champ, I'm a fat loser.  No wonder nobody ever picked me.  I picked you, Peter.  And to me and our kids, you will always be a winner.  Thanks, Lois.  And you know what? If that's true,  I don't need to play in some stupid  fantasy baseball game.  Well, guess what.  You're gonna play in that game,  and you're gonna get that hit.  And when you do, we're all gonna be there  to cheer you on.  Really? Well, how's that gonna happen?  Peter, these guys have been sexually harassing me  since the second I got here.  Either you play, or every one of these Red Sox  are going to jail Even Ted Williams.  Mmm, new meat.  I think we're gonna get along just fine.  This is the number-one fear  of only being a head.  Brian, do you always listen to the Sirius XM preview station?  Yeah, I'm thinking about pulling the trigger,  but they make you sign, like, a two-year  Guys, who cares about your dumb radio?!  We can't find Stewie anywhere.  (PHONE RINGS)  Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.  Hi, honey. How you doing?  How's Stewie?  Oh, he's great. Not lost or anything.  How's fantasy camp going?  Uh, your father broke my leg out of jealousy,  but that didn't ruin our honeymoon,  and it's not gonna ruin this.  So listen, I want all you guys  to drive up to Boston this afternoon  to see your father play in the big game.  Uh, wow, we'd love to  Mom, but we promised Stewie  we'd perform a puppet show for him later today.  Oh, you can perform it for all of us up here in Boston.  The game's in two hours.  Drive safely.  Crap! Now we got to find Stewie and write a puppet show.  We could repurpose my one-act farce.  Or we could write something fresh.  Look, just because it's already been written  doesn't mean it's not fresh.  What did I just say? Shut up!  We're in trouble. I'm in trouble.  Hey, what's this, a dickweed convention?  Stewie!  Oh, thank God you're home!  Where the hell have you been?  As far away from her as possible.  I forgot her name, honestly.  - Who, Meg? - Yes, yes, Meg. She's scary and mean,  and I don't ever want her to be in charge of me.  Are you afraid of me, little guy?  Oh, Stewie, I'm really sorry I left you in that time-out.  I love you very much, and I'm so happy you're home.  You're my little brother.  Can you forgive me?  Well all right.    (TAPPING ON WINDOW)  Can I have your baby?  Don't let her in!  We're all proud of you, Peter.  N-Now, don't be nervous.  I ain't nervous, Lois I'm just sweating  'cause I was too embarrassed to get nude in the locker room,  so I'm wearing all this over long pajamas.  P.A. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, now batting  for the Boston Red Sox, Peter Griffin!  (ROUSING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)    (GRUNTS)  (MUSIC STOPS)  Fair ball! Run, Peter! Run it out!  (COMPUTER BEEPING, PHONE RINGS)  Peter's Brain.  Yeah, uh, this is the Muscle Department.  What the hell is he doing?  Uh, apparently, he's trying to sprint.  Sprint? He got winded walking to the plate.  And he's been out in the blazing sun for two days.  Has he had any water?  No. He told his wife there's juices in the hot dogs.  Well, I'm sorry, I got no choice  but to call for a complete muscle failure.  (ALARM BLARING)  (GASPING)  Look! Dad's planking,  from, like, eight years ago!  Is there a Neiman Marcus in Boston?  Peter! Get up! Get up and run!  - Run, Peter! - Come on, Dad!  - We love you! - Copley Place. How far is that?  (ROUSING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC RESUMES)  PETER: I ran like a champion that day, pushing through the pain  of two torn hamstrings and a ruptured groin,  to leg out the hit at Fenway Park  I had always dreamed of.  But nobody noticed, 'cause the account manager from B of A  who was playing third base had a massive coronary  trying to field my crappy little nubber.  The hit was amazing, but what made it even better  was that my family was there to share the moment with me.  And on the car ride home, they put on a puppet show  that made me laugh so hard I crashed into a tollbooth  on the Mass Pike, totaling the car  and breaking Lois's other leg.  The casts kind of smell,  so I won't let her sleep in the bedroom till they're off.  But that's baseball.   TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to Sesame Street, now on HBO.  (CHEWING NOISILY)  Oh, hi, you guys. How was school?  Honestly, Mom, today was kind of weird.  Every kid in school had to write a list  of five reasons Principal Shepherd is cool  and then have their parents sign it.  What? That seems crazy.  One time, I saw him pee in a urinal  with his hands on his hips.  That's pretty boss.  Why would the principal make all the students do that?  I don't know.  I think he's going through a tough time.  He's in the middle of a bad divorce.  What? How do you know that?  He's actually been pretty open about it.  PRINCIPAL SHEPHERD: Good morning, students.  Today at 3:30,  James Woods High will be hosting a cross-country meet,  which also happens to be where Lorraine  has threatened to take my children, across the country.  And here's today's \"Tuesday Trivia\" question:  Does this sound like yelling?  Because, apparently, this sounds  to some people like yelling.  All right, finally some peace and quiet,  so I can buckle down and get some writing done.  (DRUMS PLAYING OFFBEAT)  - JOE: Hey, Bonnie! - BONNIE: What?  JOE: Listen to this. Say, \"It's all been a pack of lies.\"  BONNIE: What? Why?  JOE: Just do it! Just say, \"It's all been a pack of lies.\"  BONNIE: \"It's all been a pack of lies.\"  (DRUM BREAKDOWN FROM \"IN THE AIR TONIGHT\" PLAYS)  BONNIE: That sounded really good.  JOE: Thanks, babe. Hey, you know what that song's about?  Phil Collins watching some guy watch another guy drown.  And then, the next night, he invited the watching guy  to be in the front row of his concert  so he could sing it right to him and they could arrest the guy!  BONNIE: Really? Why wouldn't he have just  helped the guy who was drowning?  JOE: I don't know, I think he was on a bridge or something.  Like, he could see it, but he couldn't get there in time.  BONNIE: But he let a whole day pass?  Why didn't he call the cops?  JOE: 'Cause he was busy writing the song!  BONNIE: Wait, if he just watched,  doesn't that also make him a little guilty?  JOE: Look, I'm not saying we wouldn't bring Phil Collins  in for questioning.  BONNIE: I feel like maybe this story is bogus.  JOE: Hang on, let me check Snopes.  Yeah, none of that happened.  (GROANS)  Hey. What's up?  (SIGHS) Well, I'm trying to work on a sequel  to The Old Man and the Sea.  Are you, are you allowed to do that?  But I can't get anything done. It's so damn loud around here.  Oh, yeah, that's what Hemingway used to complain about.  \"This Spanish Civil War is just too loud.  How am I supposed to get anything done?\"  No, I mean, it might sound silly,  but I used to daydream that by now  I'd have my own place by a lake somewhere,  an oasis where I could go to write.  Pay the bills by renting out the rooms.  Oh, like a B and B? That could be fun.  What? What are you talking about?  I'm talking about you and me opening a B and B.  Are you serious? That'd be great!  Sure. It'll be fun.  All right, let's give it a try.  Can't be any worse than when I was on the Night's Watch.  Hey, guys, you all want to say the oath again?  (GROANS)  - For the watch. - (GROANS)  - For the watch. - (GRUNTS)  - For the watch. - (GROANS)  - Hi, Brian. - (GRUNTS)  I'm the boring storyline  of the fat guy that's watching that girl.  And I'm Ballers.  Ow! (CRYING)  I totally get it. You're right to do this.  Well, well, if it isn't Meg Griffin.  Leave me alone, you guys.  Relax. We're taking the day off from bullying.  Oh, thank God.  Very funny. Who put the Ark of the Covenant in here?  (LAUGHTER)  Meg is so stupid.  She couldn't handle the glory of God's love.  Students, faculty and staff of James Woods High,  does anyone know how to push down  the backseat of a Highlander?  I know I can make a bed in there, I just don't know how.  Oh, my God, Principal Shepherd, what's wrong?  I just listened to two hours of butt-dialed sex  between my wife and the ADT alarm guy.  Why didn't you just hang up?  (VOICE BREAKING): Because I miss the sound of her voice.  (SOBBING): Oh, my God!  SCHOOL SECRETARY (OVER P.A.): Principal Shepherd,  your wife is on the line.  She says, \"Uh, uh, oh, God, harder.\"  Man, I still can't get over how perfect this place is.  I know, it's going to be such a darling B and B.  I got the boiler up and running, Mr. Griffin.  Well, we don't have a boiler,  but I can't wait to see what you've done in the cellar.  Oh, also, please rub the \"H\" and the \"C\" off all the knobs,  so people won't know what the hell's going on.  I want the first four minutes of every shower  to be confusion and anger.  Welcome, members of our school community.  Let's call to order this emergency meeting  of the school board regarding Principal Shepherd's meltdown.  I know a number of our students have felt  (MOCKING VOICE): \"traumatized\" by the events of this week,  (NORMAL VOICE): and we take those concerns very seriously.  Lois, I'm done with my gum.  I don't want it.  But I'm done with it.  Peter, shh.  I'll take it.  So, due to his erratic behavior, we have placed  Principal Shepherd on indefinite paid leave.  Typically, Vice Principal McGuire would step in.  However, I was informed earlier today  that she was found dead in her car.  (MAN COUGHS)  Therefore, the board is seeking a parent volunteer  to serve as interim principal  until a permanent replacement can be found.  Hey, Lois, maybe I should do it. I've always wanted a job  where I can let my dandruff go wild.  What? No way.  I'm not having my dad be the principal.  How embarrassing!  Yeah, no offense, Peter, but I don't know  if you should be running a school.  What are you talking about? I'm a natural leader.  That's why I'm so good at leading Simon Says.  Simon says, \"Leave the band.\"  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, you know what? You guys are wrong.  And I'm gonna prove it to you.  Again, any volunteers?  I'll be your new principal!  Wonderful. Why don't you come on up and introduce yourself.  All right.

Check!  I'm done with this gum now.  I don't want it.  But I'm done with it.  Mom, why was this Listerine in the garbage?  Oh, your father says he doesn't need it anymore  now that he's a high school principal.  Oh, my God, he's not really doing that, is he?  I'm only gonna get bullied worse now.  Hello, Breakfast Club.  (CHUCKLES) As a principal, I like to start each morning  with a reference from last century.  Dad, I don't want you to do this.  Too late. I've already been practicing  giving students awkward and uncoordinated high fives.  Chris, if I may?  Yay! Two fingers and side-of-the-palm contact.  Perfect!  All right, I got to get to work by 7:40,  'cause that's when high school starts for some reason.  See you at the way-too-early 10:40 lunch.  (GROANS)  I feel you, Meg.  - Shut up. - You shut up!  (GUESTS CHATTERING)  Wow, look at us.

Nonsense.  Well, then why are they all signing the guest book  and writing quaint things like,  \"Railed Crystal good.\" Oh  Damn it, this is awful.  How could I have not noticed sooner?  I mean, it's more obvious  than when George Takei was in the closet.  Hey, George, how are you?  I am a heterosexual.  I love vaginas.  (CHEWING NOISES)  So, what are you doing tonight?  Hopefully, choking on some lovely lady parts.  Oh, nummers.  All right, that sounds fun. See you later.  I am a heterosexual.  Good morning, children.  I am your interim principal, Mr. Griffin.  And to show I'm a fun principal,  I'm gonna do the Ice Bucket Challenge.  Three years too late,  but right on time for a principal.  And making no less sense than it did when it was current.  (KIDS LAUGHING AND CHEERING)  You're welcome, person who's probably already dead.  But, hey, now I got something even more fun.  How about we all do an expertly choreographed lip-dub  to a popular song.  (\"UPTOWN FUNK\" BY MARK RONSON AND BRUNO MARS PLAYING)  (GUITAR RIFF PLAYING)  Ah   This hit, that ice cold   Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold   This one for them hood girls   Them good girls, straight masterpieces   Stylin', wilin', livin' it up in the city   (YELLING)  Got to kiss myself, I'm so pretty   I'm too hot   Hot damn   Call the police and the fireman   Ladies, this is my associate.  Brian, bitches.

Stewie, we're not gonna become pimps.  Are you sure?  I'm sure. The answer is no,  so don't bother flashing a wad of money,  because there's no way I'm gonna change my answer  in the middle of this sentence  Okay, maybe we could try it out and see how it goes.  Hey, what are you girls doing standing around?!  Get to work!  Ha-ha! I'm telling you,  that dog is very easily persuaded.  Now let's see what's going on at the old high school.  Ooh  Doo-ooh  Doo  Hey, guys, guys.  When Borat was making announcements  over the P.A. this morning, that was me.  What?! Shut the front door.  (IMITATING BORAT): Taco Tuesday is nice.  MEG: Knock it off! Give me back my lunch.  What do we got here?  Grape juice in a Ziploc bag?  I have to make my own Capri Suns.  Hey, stupid, what the hell are you doing?  That's my daughter!  Yeah?

A-Are you serious?  Yeah, I'm serious. I'm the principal!  Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.  What are you talking about?  That jerk is finally getting what he deserves.  Yeah, Meg, now that your dad's the principal,  you could finally have power over the bullies.  Now, you little punks get to class.  And if you see Miss Millikan, tell her I said,  \"Hey, what's up?\"  Huh.  Maybe you're right.  Wow, Dad, that was really something.  Miss Millikan's just a friend.  Oh, I don't mean that.  I mean the way you handled those guys  that were picking on me.  Really? I felt like I kind of lost my cool there.  Not at all.  That's what you've got to do more of.  - You were like a real principal there. - I was?  Yeah. In fact, if you're gonna lead this school,  you've got to know that kids need discipline.  Especially kids like them.  And their friends, Jeremy and Bridget.  Oh, really?  Where might I find this Jeremy and Bridget?  I don't know, study hall, second floor?  (LOUD CHATTER)  All right, listen up, maggots!

What'd he do?  He wouldn't kiss Ruth at the Sadie Hawkins dance,  even though she bought him dinner before  at Walt's Roast Beef.  Well, I don't see how that's got anything to do  And he called you fat.  Oh, I'm gonna squish him!  That's right.  Don't take any crap from anyone.  Oh, I won't.  I'm gonna take down all these punks,  just like I did in my 1980s crime series,  Gary Ratowski, Hockey Cop.  Gimme that purse!  Hey, criminals.  Puck you!  (SKATES CLACKING ON CEMENT)  Get the puck out of my neighborhood.  Go puck yourself.  (SIREN WAILING)  Uh-oh, here come the real cops.  ANNOUNCER: Hockey Cop, not a cop.  All right, ladies, I'm going to put this  as gently as I can,  but it appears that someone's rectum  fell out on the stairs.  Now, whose is it? Be honest.  All right, that's fine.  But let's just agree on a rule  that if your rectum falls out on the stairs,  it's on you to pick it up.  Look at that, Brian.  Our day has just begun, and there's a line out the door.  I know, we're raking it in.  This is a hell of a lot easier  than when I delivered pizza in New Orleans.  (BAND PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC)  What the hell?  We're all just blocking the street   We're all just blocking the street   Come on, I got to deliver this pizza.  Five trumpets do the job of one   We're all just blocking the street   I need to be there in 30 minutes.  It's a company promise!  Half the band isn't in the band   We're all just blocking the street   Oh, thank God.  One of us dropped a contact lens   We're going back to block the street   Ah, screw it.  We won't stop blocking the street   Never stop blocking the street.   Okay, so I think Lee Blanding gets detention.  And for Jason O'Neil,  maybe you could pants him during an assembly.  Yes, good.

Lamps That Look Like Soccer Balls.  Yes?  Okay. How many would you like to return?  Yeah, just send them here, care of  Mr. Butterworth.  (LIVELY CHATTER)  Ah, it's so nice getting out of the house.  If I had to change one more diaper, I was gonna lose it.  I'm in exactly the same boat.  I mean, what would our husbands do  if they had to change their own diapers?  Different boat, Bonnie. Much different boat.  Hey, I got an idea.  Let's crank call them.  - Me first. - (LINE RINGING)  (CRYING): You're weak, Cleveland!  You're worthless and weak!  (PHONE RINGING)  You found Brown.  - Hello, Cleveland. - (GIGGLING)  This is Michelle Obama.  It is?!  Yes. I received all your letters,  and I do like your mustache.  Oh. I've been doing all your arm exercises.  Thank you, but those won't work on your fat arms.  How do you know my arms are fat?  I deliberately left them out of all the photos.  You're eating a pie on the toilet, aren't you, Cleveland?  Who is this? Is this a Jerky Boy?!  It's your wife, you big dummy!  (LAUGHTER, PHONE BEEPS OFF)  (SOBBING)  I used to have my own show.  (LAUGHTER)  (LINE RINGING)  - (PHONE RINGING) - Hello?  (DISGUISED VOICE): Hello. Is this Joe Swanson?  Wait.

Don't you ever call here again!  - (LINE CLICKS) - What the hell?!  He just got mad and hung up.  He what? Why?  I don't know. He sounded weird.  Like when he was an NFL announcer and had to pretend  he cared about the shows after the game.  PETER: Patriots calling their third and final timeout.  Hey, after the game, keep it here  for an all-new Madam Secretary.  Tonight, Madam Secretary faces  an international crisis in Pakistan,  while her teenage daughter faces her own crisis  finding a date for the prom.  Madam Secretary, tonight on CBS.  (SIGHS HEAVILY)  Is this the longest time-out of all time?  Hey, Peter.  So, um, anything interesting happen tonight?  Yup. I finally peed that chunk of poo off the side of the bowl.  You know the one you've been yelling at me about?  Nobody called or anything?  Nope. So, hey, uh, are you tipsy enough  to let me have lazy Tony Soprano sex?  You know, where-where I just lie there  and arch my hips a little bit and breathe like a dying whale?  Uh, I don't know.  All right, well, just in case, I'll be upstairs  getting into my boxers and black socks.  (PANTING HEAVILY)  Do you think it's possible  he actually has an illegitimate child?  I don't know, but something's going on,  because I'm telling you, he lied right to my face.  Sometimes friends put wine out for each other.  I just don't understand it.  I mean, we don't keep secrets in this house.  We didn't even keep the Pop Secret's secret.  Psst. Hey, did you hear?  Hear what?  Orville Redenbacher is gay.  But he has a son.  He's in the commercial.  His son's gay, too. They're both gay.  They have sex parties in the Hollywood Hills.  It sounds like you're just making up stories  about your competitors.  You're gay, too.  - What? - (KISSING NOISES)  Aah! You're a psycho!  Dad, you're never gonna believe what  Chris, meet Orville Redenbacher and his son. Watch.  And that's where we get the expression  \"gay as a bag of popcorn.\"  All right, I'll see you later.  What? Where are you going?  Laser tag orientation.  Well, that's obviously not true.  Yeah, that boy got lie-arrhea.  Oh, my God. I-I got to follow him,  find out where he's really going.  Good idea. If I was you,  I'd stick to him like glue-arrhea.  Okay, I think I'm starting to crack your code.  Quick, Brian, I need your car.  I don't know, Lois.  You're not on the insurance, and I don't think that  (MOANING)  (KNOCKING)  MAN: Fruit Bouquet for Brian Griffin?  Happy birthday, buddy.    (TIRES SCREECHING)  What the hell?  Peter, what are you doing here?  Lois! Uh, uh  I was I'm just, uh, shopping.  Yeah, I'll-I'll take a large sperm, please.  Nice going, now you've ruined Christmas.  Peter Griffin, you tell me what's going on right now.  (SIGHS) Okay, fine, I'll be honest with you.  A long while back, just before we got married,  I was a little short of cash.  What, to buy our rings?  No, I wanted to pay for dial-up modem impression classes. See?  (DIAL-UP MODEM BEEPING, STATIC CRACKLING)  Wow, that's pretty good. I  (IMITATES AOL VOICE): You've got mail.  Okay, but hang on. You were a sperm donor?  Yeah, I'd-I'd almost forgotten about it,  but then last night, I get this call from a woman  who says she's my daughter.  Peter, that was me. I was prank calling you.  You what?!  I can't believe you would do that to me!  MAN: Can you guys argue elsewhere?  You're making it tough to finish in here.  MAN 2: No, fight louder! Call her a bitch!  But I don't understand.  Why did you come here today?  'Cause that call last night gave me a scare.  I figured if I do have a kid out there,  I want to make sure they're not giving out my information.  They're not supposed to; I signed a form.  Hold on, Peter.  I'm sorry I tricked you,  but if you do have a child out there,  isn't it only fair to let him or her meet you?  Eh, maybe you're right.  I mean, as long as we're here,  maybe you should sign a consent form.  Okay, yeah.  All right, I'll do it.  You know what?  It feels good doing something nice for others.  Like when I was a mentor for Kid Rock.  Okay, I took a leak into this can of Busch Light  without spilling.  You're ready.  You don't need me anymore.  Will I see you again, Peter?  Wherever a father weighs less than his daughter,  I'll be there.  Wherever someone has a banner for a football team  as a curtain, I'll be there.  Wherever there's a fight in a Waffle House,  I'll be there.  Now go.  People need a concert to go to after the water park.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Hi, is, uh, is Peter Griffin here?  Oh, my God.  Is everything okay?  Yes, it's just you look just like  What's going on? Who's this supermodel?  I'm Katie.  I'm your daughter.  You're what?  Holy crap!  Yeah, I hope you don't mind the drop-in,  but the, uh, the sperm bank said it was okay to contact you.  Wow, I guess, I guess I just didn't expect this so soon.  Well, we were all pretty excited to meet you.  What do you mean \"we\"?  ALL: Hi, Dad!  We're all your children. We came from your semen.  \"Semen.\" (LAUGHS LIKE PETER)  (ALL LAUGHING LIKE PETER)  - \"Semen.\" - \"Semen.\"  Ha-ha!  Oh, sorry. Wrong house.  Look, Eddie's at the wrong house.  - Ha-ha! - Ha-ha!  - Ha-ha! - Ha-ha!  (LIVELY CHATTER)  Peter, how many times were you a sperm donor?  Only once, but I had just seen Uma Thurman in Beautiful Girls,  so it was kind of a ka-blamo.  You ever seen those videos where they put Mentos in Diet Coke?  Uh, listen, I want all of you to know  how happy we are to meet you.  In fact, this calls for a celebration.  Can you all stay for dinner?  Aw, we'd love that. Wouldn't we, guys?  Yeah, absolutely.  You said it, babe.  Yeah, Chinese Peter very hungry.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, Lois.  Just 'cause they're my kids and they all look like me  doesn't mean we have anything in common.  (FARTS NOTES FROM CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND)  (GASPS)  (FARTS NOTES FROM CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND)  Daddy.  (FARTS NOTES FROM CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND)  (FARTS THE SAME NOTES)  (ALL FARTING RAPIDLY IN HARMONY)  I've never felt proud of any of my children until now.  This is so exciting.  For years, I have dreamed of one day traveling from Bavaria  to play the accordion for my birth family.  May I?  (DISCORDANT ACCORDION PLAYING)  I have just one question for you.  What are those?!  Oh, I get that because this comedy  has just made it to Germany.  Wow, you look exactly like me.  (RUSSIAN ACCENT): Yes, I'm not actually part  of sperm donation thing.  I'm your secret clone.  We have been Orphan Black-ed and you soon will be dead.  (SILENCED GUNSHOT)  LOIS: Meg, where are you?  (MEG'S VOICE): I'm right here, Mom.  Well, look at your fine ass.  Are you talking to me?  Damn right.  I've been looking around this whole house  for something to nibble on.  I think I just found it.  So many confusing feelings!  - Dad. - Sex.  Black woman.  Historically-low mortgage rates.  Ah! I got to go buy a house.  Lois, Lois.  Can I keep the little person Peter?  No. They're too much work.  But I'll take care of it. I promise.  You always say that, and I'm the one who ends up  feeding him and walking him and doing all the clean up.  Excuse me, I'm a candidate  for a doctorate in Classics at Wesleyan.  It talks! Lois, it talks!  (GRUNTS)  Whoa, that was close.  You almost dipped one of your yabbos in the marinara.  Let me help you with those.  Well, thank you. That's so sweet.  You're the first person who looks anything like my husband  who's offered to help in any way.  Oh, you must be Peter's wife, Lois.  I'm Larry.  It's nice to meet you, Larry.  Weird hands-full pinky shake?  I got to tell you, it's so strange,  you look so much like Peter when I first met him.  Well, I'm guessing you look exactly the same, too.  You're in such great shape.  Well, I do have tiny blue weights in my garage.  (BOTH LAUGH)  (KNOCK AT DOOR)  Oh, hi, Larry.  Hi, Lois. Is Peter here?  Larry, it's only 2:00 in the afternoon.  Peter's still sleeping off last night's party.  Then why why are you still in your pajamas and bathrobe?  Oh, that's because I'm depressed.  Is that why that sad Shel Silverstein blob  is following you around?  Who would ever (BLEEP) me?  Anyway, we didn't really get a chance  to finish our conversation yesterday,  and I thought maybe we could grab some lunch together.  Huh. That would give me a reason to get dressed today.  Oh. Would you, uh, like to join us?  That didn't sound like a real invitation.  See, this is why no one ever wants to (BLEEP) you.  Thank you again for lunch, Larry.  Sorry I drew so many Nazi symbols on the place mat.  - I was just nervous. - That's okay.  I just wish we hadn't gone to a kosher restaurant.  Ugh, but look at me.  I got ice cream all over my fingers.  Do you have a napkin?  No, but let me help you clean it off.  Larry, are you turned on or starving?  Can't it be both?  (BONES SNAP)  - Mm. - Mm.  Wow, Larry, that was unexpected.  Shh, we'll discuss this later.  - I have to get back to my high school - Oh.  - Where I work - Oh.  - As a janitor - Oh.  - To pay for medical school - Oh.  - That I'm building - Oh!  - Out of Popsicle sticks. - Oh.  That big one doesn't blink a lot, does he?  Hey, Lois, where's your purse?  Me and some of my kids are going to the movies.  By the way, Dwarf Peter died.  I didn't know what he ate, so I gave him nothing.  His name was Tyler.  He had a name.  Everything you say, you say with pride.  I like that about you.  Anyway, where's Larry?  Maybe he wants to go to the movie.  Larry?  Why would I know where Larry is?  And who is Larry?  Well, never mind.  All right, everybody bring your phones  so we can text each other during the movie.  Wow, you want to tell me what that was?  Oh, Brian, Larry and I sort of crossed a line yesterday.  I don't know, he's just so sweet and fun-loving,  and for God's sake,  he looks just like Peter did when he was his age.  Yeah, but?  Well, he kissed me and I kind of let him.  I told him it could never happen again and that  What are you doing?  Oh, I-I thought that was kind of like, \"I'm open for business.\"  No! I'm confiding in a friend.  Oh! You're the safe friend.  Look, I feel awful about it, but I told Larry that was it,  and we couldn't be anything more than friends.  So, you're still gonna see him?  Yes, of course; he's a nice young man  and he's practically family.  ZOLOFT BLOB: Lois!  No! Zoloft Blob, don't!  (GUNSHOT)  (GROANS)  Is everything okay?  Yeah, I-I'm fine, I just hurt my neck this morning  vigorously nodding approval to Judge Judy.  Okay, all right, the doctor is in.  Come on, back it up over here.  Somebody's got a neck massage coming.  Ah, right there.  Okay, but let's keep this friendly.  You can choke me for just a second.  You know, maybe I should just go ahead and do your whole back.  Yeah, your bra strap is getting in the way here.  I'll just bite it off with my teeth.  Lois, is a president stronger than a king?  What the hell?!  Oh, Peter.  L-Look, calm down. We're just friends.  H-He's just giving me a friendly massage.  A friendly massage?!  Yeah, and what do you care?  When's the last time you did anything nice for me?  I ate that gross pasta you made.  I might as well just tell you, Peter.  I'm in love with Lois.  I knew it the moment we kissed.  Kissed?!  Is that true?!  Yes, Peter, but I  You son of a bitch!    (GRUNTS)  (PANTING)  (GRUNTING)  Everybody says, \"We don't need a homeowners' association.  That's stupid, Quagmire.\"  Well, this is why a homeowners' association.  (GRUNTS IN SLOW MOTION)  (GRUNTS)  What the hell?!  Lois?!  What'd you do that for?  I thought you and him were girlfriend and boyfriend.  He was not my boyfriend, Peter.  And I wasn't about to stand by and watch him kick your ass.  I was holding my own there.  You were getting beat up.  No, no, I meant I was holding my own nuts  so he wouldn't kick them.  But if he's not your boyfriend, why'd you kiss him?  He kissed me.  And I should've told you.  I'm sorry if I hurt you, Peter.  I guess Larry just reminded me of a younger version of you,  and the truth is,  I liked that he was paying me a little attention,  the way you used to.  (SIGHS)  Maybe I have been taking you for granted,  but I promise I'll make it up to you.  I'll be the best husband ever.  You already are.  For God's sakes, when push came to shove,  you stood toe-to-toe with a much younger man and fought for me.  Oh, hey, by the way, uh, thanks, all my kids,  for stepping in to help.  Really, really appreciate that.  But you're right, Lois. I'm gonna change.  I'm gonna do all the stuff for you that Larry was doing.  No, Peter, I don't need any of that.  At our age, all I'm really looking for in a husband  is someone who wants to watch TV with me on a Saturday night  and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back.  \"Afraid\"? I love doing that.  It's like bubble wrap  you get to have sex with every now and then.  I got a pretty good one going right now, Peter.  You always do, Lois.  I love you.  Mm.  NARRATOR: From that day forward, Peter and Lois never again  Ooh, nope, sorry, there's still another scene left.  Well, Peter, turns out your initial instinct was right.  You never should've let any of your children contact you.  You said it.  From now on, I'm making sure my sperm  stays right where it belongs: in the bathroom sink.  (LAUGHTER)   (LAUGHS LIKE PETER)  (LAUGHS LIKE PETER)  (ALL LAUGHING LIKE PETER)  (PETER'S VOICE): We have fun down here.   Peter, come on, time to get dressed  for our Valentine's Day dinner.  We don't want to be late for our reservation.  Reservation?  Yeah. I decided we're going someplace nice this time.  Not like last year when we went to the Outback Steakhouse,  but it's \"out\" as in the gay way.  We'll get to the specials, but first, I need to tell you  I'm gay.  The hell you are!  No waiter of mine is gonna be gay!  Peter, please. He's our waiter.  He's the only waiter we have.  Lois, our waiter is dead to us.  We have to focus all our attention on our hostess now.  He-he just needs a little time.  (WEAKLY): Scott  I'm finally ready to hear the specials.  Well, happy Valentine's Day, Lois.  Let's have a dying marriage side-face kiss.  Mwah.  Well, I better set out a can of tuna fish and a cigar  for Arthur Valentine.  I can't wait to see what he brings me.  Uh, you want to tell us what the holy hell that was?  (SIGHS) I'm afraid it's something we made up  that we finally need to deal with.  You see, years ago, when Chris was in preschool  (CRYING)  Peter, poor Chris didn't get a single valentine today  from any of his classmates.  What? Why not?  Apparently, he's not well liked.  Some of the kids think he's weird  because he takes his shirt off to pee.  Yeah, I taught him that. That's also called \"peeing.\"  Pee? Pee now?  No. No, Chris.  (CRYING): Why no valentines?  Hey, hey, hey, stop crying, Chris.  Y-You're gonna  Y-You're gonna get tons of valentines.  I am? From who?  Um, from Arthur Valentine.  R-Really?  Yeah, yeah, that's right!  Who's Arthur Valentine?  Only the most magical man ever.  And he comes every Valentine's Day on-on a-a  a purple Vespa to, um  to bring candy and sweet notes to children  who've managed to not use any swears in the last year.  He does?  Uh-huh, and he has a long beard  Oh, and-and he's got an eye patch.  B-But not for medical reasons, he just likes the look.  Plus, he-he wears a Cat in the Hat hat  and sometimes a scarf, no matter what Lois says  because it gives him a youthful vibe  and adds some color to his face.  We were just trying to cheer Chris up.  I assumed he'd outgrow it in a few years,  but, Peter, it's time we have a talk with Chris.  We've got to put an end to this Arthur Valentine nonsense.  (SIGHS) Yeah, I guess you're right.  Well, I best be going anyway.  Donna and I are spending our Valentine's Day  in Johnnie Cochran pajamas, just caressing each other  in a very beige bedroom.  Yeah, and hopefully Bonnie and I'll  do a sexy bath night like last year.  It was amazing.  She laid out a trail of rose petals,  and I elbow-crawled to the sponge and shower chair.  I go down to the video store and put my hand on Love Actually  at the same time as a woman, and I go,  (LAUGHING): \"Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!\"  What about you, Brian? What are your plans for Valentine's Day?  What? Oh, uh, no real plans, I guess.  Ha! Looks like Brian's the only guy with nothing going on.  Hey, you can come over to my house, Brian.  I thought you had that whole thing with Bonnie.  I do, but she needs help lifting me into the shower chair.  Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.  Our top story, today the Quahog River was dyed red  in honor of Valentine's Day.  So if you're looking to do a river murder,  this could be your window.  (SLURRING): Stupid Hallmark holiday anyway.  Oh, hey, Bri. How's your night going?  I hope Rupert and I haven't been too loud up there.  - Happy Valentine's Day! - (CLANKING LOUDLY)  Oh, yeah, we're gonna go all night.  Just leave me alone, Stewie.  Well, Brian, if you're stuck being a single loser,  you might as well just embrace it.  Mmm. Oh, yeah. (GRUNTS)  Wait a minute. What am I thinking?  Chocolate is poisonous to dogs. I better stop or  - (POT CLANKING LOUDLY) - STEWIE: Happy Valentine's Day!  CLEVELAND: Stop the damn banging!  People are trying to have dignified relations!  Oh, boy, look!  Arthur Valentine brought me plates and a salt shaker!  Chris, Chris, settle down.  I-It's actually time your father and I  had a talk with you about Arthur Valentine.  Yeah, that's, uh, that's right.  Um, son  I'm afraid Arthur Valentine isn't real.  What? Not real? (CHUCKLES)  Then who leaves those notes with all the misspellings?  Well, first, Chris, English is a very fluid language.  We're sorry, but you're old enough now to know the truth.  He he doesn't exist.  (GASPS) No! You're both lying!  (SIGHS) What are we gonna do?  It seems like there's no getting through to him.  You know, if Chris is this hard to convince,  we may just have to kill Arthur Valentine.  What? What do you mean?  Maybe we make Chris believe that Arthur Valentine is dead.  Huh. Well, we just might have to.  Hey, what's the matter, Brian?  Have you fallen and can't get up?  Turns out, still using that joke is a felony.  Guess I better not drop the soap.  That one's the death penalty.  You were very lucky.  We managed to pump your stomach just in time.  Oh, thank God.  I had him pump my stomach, too. Doc, what was in there?  Well, it's a pretty extensive list.  I'm gonna need Billy Joel to help me out.  Lots of Legos, rubber bands, web-shooting Spider-Man   An old pet rock, an antique clock, a ton of red Play-Doh   Colored pencils, lots of nickels   Half a jar of Vlasic Pickles   Banjo strings, chicken wings, Cassingle by Skee-Lo   I didn't poop those items   They were in my tummy 'cause they all looked yummy   He didn't poop those items   He tried to eat 'em, so you shouldn't feed him.   (SONG ENDS)  Wow, that was great, Billy!  Hey, does anyone call you Bill Joel or William Joel?  Uh, no. Does anyone call you Petey Griffin?  No, they don't, because I'm an adult,  which is kind of what I was getting at.  Ugh. Who sends a Christmas card to their vet?  I know. It's so lame, right?  And did you see the lady outside with the empty cat carrier?  Ugh. Cry much?  Yeah. Yeah, I bet she actually thinks that thing loved her.  (CHUCKLES) Hey, I'm Brian.  Shake.  Nice to meet you. I'm Ellie.  What are you in for?  Uh, I got this small cut, and they wanted to bandage it  so I'd stop chewing the crap out of my foot.  Aw, that sucks. I love chewing the crap out of my foot.  I know, it's the best.  But while I was here, I also had to get  (DOG BARKING NEARBY)  (BOTH BARKING)  a prescription filled.  Listen, I got to go.  You want to continue this sometime?  Let me give you my number. It's on the back of here.  - It's this. - Got it.  See you around, Brian.  Definitely.  Bye, Ellie.  (GERMAN ACCENT): Is this the Veteran Aryan's office?  No, this is the veterinarian's.  I think you want the Veteran Aryan's Center next door.  Ah, I see the confusion. This must happen all the time.  We're ready for the German shepherd.  (GERMAN ACCENT): Ja, that would be me.  This is a very confusing lobby.  (CHUCKLING)  Hey. Hey.  You think you could be with me? Right here? In this place?  Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry. Sorry, Stewie.  It's-it's just  I met someone amazing the other day at the vet's office, and  Well, she's actually a dog.  And it's so great dating someone who understands  why it's especially important to walk around in a circle  many, many times before lying down.  So, that's who you were texting with?  Sort of. I-I was just rereading some of the texts  I already sent her.  (CHUCKLES) That's good.  You're rereading your own texts?  Yeah, do you, do you not do that?  Nobody does that.  Golden Eagle to Red Shrew. Ready for the plan?  Come in, Red Shrew.  LOIS (OVER WALKIE): Peter, we did not decide on those names.  Chris, come down here, quick! I see Arthur Valentine outside!  I think he's come to say hi!  Really?!  Yeah, look.  Oh, my God. Hi, Arthur!  I love you so much, and I haven't cussed once today!  Dad, get the bowl of tuna from under my bed!  (SCREAMS) Arthur!  Oh, my God, he's dead.  He's dead!  (SOBBING LOUDLY)  Mission accomplished, Red Shrew. Over and out.  Huh. That looks tasty.  Little walkie-talkie piece.  God, I forgot how much I love art.  Hey, who's your favorite artist?  Me? Uh  (STAMMERS)  You know, I really like, uh, that Jackson \"Polack.\"  You know, I-I know they're not supposed to be that bright,  but that was, that was pretty genius, you know?  I mean, leave it, leave it to a Polack to just grab the paint  with his hands and just start chucking it everywhere.  I mean, it's great.  It's pronounced \"Pollock.\" (CHUCKLES)  But, Brian, you don't have to keep trying so hard  to impress me.  I already really like you.  You do? Thanks.  I-I really like you, too, Ellie.  Truth is, I haven't felt this way with anyone in a long time.  Listen, I'm really sorry to cut things short,  but I've got to go; I have rehearsal.  - Oh, what, for a play? - No.  It's kind of dumb, but it's for a dog show.  Oh, you're a show dog?  No wonder you have such a perfectly coiffed anus.  Thank you.  No, thank you. It's perfect.  I mean, I God, I-I bet every time you go snaffling on it,  you have to stop and admire it.  Come on, now, Brian.  A lady has to have a few secrets.  Man, she is something else.  This must be how Ronald Reagan felt about Nancy.  Nancy, will you make me the happiest man in the world  by turning a blind eye to the AIDS crisis  and ineffectually trying to warn young people about drugs?  Yes!  Oh, yes, Ronnie! Yes!  SINGERS:  If you're too young   Those are both things she did!   Peter, I'm really worried about Chris.  The shock of seeing Arthur Valentine die  seems to have really gotten to him.  I-I've never seen him so depressed and catatonic.  Well, you know, in Awakenings,  Robin Williams tossed a baseball to Robert De Niro,  and he snapped out of it and caught it.  M-Maybe we do that.  Chris, you doing okay?  It's Mom and Dad.  We thought we'd Awakenings!  Peter, I'm not sure that's  Awakenings!  You're gonna hurt him if you  Awakenings!  Peter, knock it off.  I never thought Chris would take things so hard.  I think we went too far by killing Arthur Valentine.  We have to bring him back to life.  What? Are you serious?  It's the only thing that'll snap him out of it.  Well, maybe, but what if I try it with a basketball?  Awakenings!  Oh, God, that broke his nose.  He didn't even flinch. It's bad. Let's do your thing.  Let's-let's twirl some toilet paper up into his nose,  and-and then when we'll-we'll do your thing.  Wow, thanks again.  What a nice dinner.  I'm so lucky to have met you, Brian.  You're such an amazing guy.  I'd say we're both lucky.  Oh, no, no, no, wait!  (SIGHS) Don't-don't do that.  What-what? What's the matter?  Oh, brutal.  Yeah, that's gonna be a terrible car ride, man.  I would hate to be you, and I'm me.  I'm really sorry, Brian.  It's not that I don't want to kiss you.  I smell the poop on your breath, and then that's all I want,  but my owners made an arrangement  with the organizers of the next dog show.  They paid a lot of money to schedule me to breed  with whichever male dog wins the competition.  What, like like breed breed?  I know it might seem odd to you,  but this happens in the dog show world.  I have to have sex with whichever male dog wins,  whoever that ends up being.  Stewie, we're entering a dog show!  - Where's Stewie? - STEWIE (MUFFLED): He ate me!  - I ate him. -  He ate Stewie, holy crap   Family Guy will be right back!   All right Brian, now if we're going to get you  ready to compete in that dog show,  we've got a lot of training to cover.  Let's begin by doing some work with the clicker.  - (CLICKER CLICKS) - Oh, yeah, I've seen these.  You click it when you want me to do a trick,  and then I get a treat, so I associate the two.  No. I use it to punctuate my jokes.  Now, Brian you've got to roll over and be good on all fours.  If Nathan Lane can do it, so can you.  - (CLICKER CLICKS) - Okay. (CHUCKLES)  But maybe we should just focus on getting ready for the show.  Well, look who wants to be prepared.  - You're a regular Beagle Scout. - (CLICKER CLICKS)  Wait, shouldn't I be the one who clicks if I like the joke?  You can't just click after everything you say.  If it's funny, I can. And so far, they've all landed.  Unlike the planes on 9/11.  See? No click.  That one was in poor taste. Not funny.  You know, I was supposed to be on one of those planes.  Yeah, me, too.  Um, yes. Brian Griffin.  ELLIE: Brian?  What are you doing here?  (CHUCKLES): Oh, hey!  Uh, you know, I You-you just made dog shows  sound so fun the other day, I-I thought I'd give it a try.  Who knows? Maybe I'll end up top dog.  And on top of you. (CHUCKLES)  - (CLICKER CLICKS) - Thanks, Stewie.  Brian, most of these dogs have been training since birth.  Are you sure you're ready for this?  You bet I am. I've never been so prepared.  I'm a regular Beagle Scout.  (BOTH LAUGHING)  That's hilarious.  Good luck, Brian.  (LAUGHS)  Chris, you got to snap out of this.  I mean, I've been where you're at.  (QUIETLY): Listen, I've never told anyone this,  but I killed a jaywalker in 2002.  She looked old, but she was only 51.  I mean, back then, that was old to me.  It's why I always talk and ask questions so much.  When there's any moment of quiet, I think about her.  That's why all mothers do that.  Every mother has killed someone.  Now drink your ginger ale.  Hey, hey, hey!  It's Arthur Valentine,  here to accelerate awkwardly into a bush.  Damn it!  Arthur  Valentine?  Chris! You're okay!  But I saw him die.  That can only mean one thing.  He must be a zombie!  What? No! No, no. What?!  (YELLING)  (SCREAMS) Stop!  What the hell are you doing?!  (SCREAMS)  I've seen The Walking Dead!  I have to destroy your brain  and then talk about it for the next hour!  - Chris, take it easy! - Get off of him!  - You're gonna kill me! - It's not what you think!  Dad?  But I don't  I How did  I'm not Arthur Valentine, son.  We're so sorry, Chris.  Now do you understand?  There is no Arthur Valentine?  We never meant to hurt you, buddy.  JOE: Valentine's Day would take on new meaning for Chris  in the years to come,  but he would remember none so bittersweetly as this one.  This is Joe Swanson, signing off.  BONNIE: Joe, your mom died.  Seriously?  How you doing? You feeling good?  Because this thing is gonna come down to the arbitrary whims  of whatever elderly volunteers  were able to get transportation here on a Tuesday.  Yeah, I Hey, watch it!  The hell's his problem?  Careful. That's your competition.  His name's Max.  He's a four-time winner and kind of a crowd favorite.  (APPLAUSE)  ANNOUNCER: Okay, who wants to start the dog show?  - Who wants to start it? - (DOGS BARKING)  Yes, you all want to start the dog show, don't you?  Don't you? (VOCALIZING IN BABY VOICE)      (APPLAUSE)  ANNOUNCER: That'll do it for the males.  And as our judges tabulate the results,  we can now announce our female division.  The winning bitch, for the tenth year in a row,  is Katherine Heigl!  - (CLICKER CLICKS) - Thank you, thank you.  No, but for real, it's that dog Ellie over there.  (APPLAUSE)  And our winner in the male division is  Brian Griffin!  - (APPLAUSE) - Yes!  Man, thank you for all your help, Stewie.  I really couldn't have done it  What the What's going on?  (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE)  This-this is it?  It's happening right here? Right now?  Uh-huh. They have to certify the union, Brian.  Stud is ready to mount.  Please turn up the lights.  What? No! No, the opposite!  In fact, could someone maybe turn on  some-some Drake or The Weekend?  Ha! He's blowing it! He can't do it!  Quagmire?! What are you doing here?  Oh, I have an all-access pass  to anything in this town that's sex-related.  Offering manual assistance.  Commencing union.  Okay, okay, thanks, man, but, yeah, no,  I-I got this, I got this.  If-if you just-just give me a second to get, like,  a scenario in my head.  Uh, maybe a hot babysitter who needs to pay for college  - so she, uh - (DOGS BARKING)  Can somebody please shut those dogs up?!  This specimen is unable to perform.  Please bring in the boxer.  ELLIE (GRUNTING): I'm sorry, Brian, but this is  what I was trying to tell you.  I'm sorry, too, but I see now that you were right.  I'm just not sure how this could work  or-or how our relationship could fit into your world.  QUAGMIRE: Hey, less talk!  I guess this is good-bye.  ELLIE: I guess it is.  I'll always remember you, Brian.  And I'll always remember you, Ellie.  (GRUNTING): I promise to name one of the puppies after you.  Let's just cross our fingers (PANTING)  it's not one of the ones he eats.  Thanks. That means a lot  Okay, we're at the part where he bites down  on the back of my neck, so we should probably wrap this up.  Yup.  Whoa! Max's grandfather may have been a horse.  Come on, let's just go home.  Okay.  Is this the romantic ending you were hoping for?  Look, that was a tricky situation, all right?  The lights, the people watching.  If-if it hadn't been for all that, I  trust me, I-I would've, I would've set her world on fire.  No way. You didn't even start the fire.  Oh, no.  Nancy Reagan, preschool Chris   Sey valet, young Lois   German guy, lots of dogs   Arthur Valentine   We didn't write an ending   So we're all together, trying to make it better   They didn't write an ending   But what the heck? I'll still take the check   The check, the check.   (SONG ENDS)  Mom killed a jaywalker.   What are you doing to Dad?  What? I'm going to the grocery store.  Okay, you remember Memento? That.  Don't forget the cucumbers, Peter.  All right. Where's that?  Oh, hey, right, 'cause of that thing we started doing.  By the way, speaking of which, best \"O\" ever.  I felt dirty for an hour, but it's gone now.  Now I just can't wait for night.  I wish you hadn't said that at full volume  in front of our children.  I can't tell if they have a really good marriage  or a really bad one.  I feel like it's weird but strong.  Like Danny Trejo.  Thank you for noticing.  You ready for movie marathon day, Rupert?  Ah, I was born ready, too.  All right, time for Fast and the Furious  one through seven.  All right, let's get (BLEEP) high.  You can't be high for this, Brian.  This is serious stuff.  This is a 14-hour meditation  on the importance of family, fast cars,  product placement, racial ambiguity and family.  Where's eight? Didn't that one just come out?  Someone said they were going to get me eight  on Blu-ray for my birthday,  and someone got me a limited edition  Michael Kors pebbled leather tote bag instead.  - You love that bag. - I know. You're the best.  Okay, put in Fast 6.  You're starting with six?  Um, yeah. We're going in order from best to worst.  Six, five, seven, three I know that's controversial  One, four, two.  By the way, don't tell Rupert  about Paul Walker being D-E-A-D.  He doesn't know.  All right. So, what's the plot?  Oh, you don't understand these movies.  (TIRES SQUEALING OVER TV)  What was that, Rupert?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  No.  I don't know. Maybe? Maybe bi?  That's Ludacris. That's not Tyrese.  What are you talking about? They look nothing alike.  Ludacris looks like a human peanut,  and Tyrese looks slick.  He looks like a Chinese black.  Like Africa and Asia had sex  while Europe sat on a chair  in the corner of the hotel room and watched.  Ludacris, human peanut. Tyrese, Chinese black.  Are you gonna keep talking like this during the whole thing?  What? I'm answering Rupert's questions.  Now we're gonna have to rewind.  We just missed the scene where half the team steals a tank  while the other half pretends to be a DJ for some reason.  - Damn it. - Yeah, okay.  - I'm going to the bar. - Suit yourself.  Rupert and I are just fine without you.  (DOOR CLOSES)  (LAUGHS) You're right.  I bet he is on his period.  Whatever that means.  La, la, la, la. Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Gross, gross, gross. Ew, ew, ew.  No, no, no. No. Ew. Ew.  A loaf of bread, a container of milk  and a stick of butter.  A loaf of milk, a container of bread  and a Joe Dirt DVD.  A Joe Dirt DVD, Scarlett Johansson  and treasure from a fish tank.  P.A. ANNOUNCER: Attention, shoppers.  Beloved cereal icon Boo Berry  is now greeting customers in aisle six.  (GASPS) Boo Berry?  The Boo Berry?  Are there imposter Boo Berries?  Hey, watch it.  Oh, Mr. Boo Berry, I'm your biggest fan.  You're not the one threatening me  on Facebook, are you?  No, no. No, not-not you. Not you.  Hey, you know what I always loved about your cereal?  It tasted like blueberries.  Oh, my God. Boo Berries.  And you're and you're a ghost.  'Cause So that-that's the \"boo.\"  Did you guys know you were doing that? Oh, my God.  - Anyway, can I shake your hand? - Sure.    (GASPS)  I've been touched by greatness.  I am never washing this hand again.  This is the best thing to happen to me  since I became a wisecracking,  fourth-wall-breaking superhero.  Call me Redstool.  The treatment didn't give me powers,  but it did spread cancer to my anus.  Just call me anus   Of the morning   Anus   Just touch my cheek   Before you leave me   Anus   This violence juxtaposed to music   Anus   Decapitation   In slow-motion   Anus.   (ACTION MUSIC PLAYS ON TV)  (YAWNS)  Sorry, Rupert. I think I'm down for the count.  You okay if I go to bed?  Oh, I like that we're comfortable doing things separately, too.  Good night.  Do me a favor and don't wake me when you come up, though.  Yes, you do. You always step on the creaky board.  Yes, you do. Every time.  No, you're being a little bitch.  Don't go to bed angry.  Don't go to bed angry.  Defuse. Defuse.  Rupert, I'm sorry.  I overreacted.  Now you say you're sorry.  What do you mean, \"For what\"?  I hate you!  (GROANS)  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I love you. I value you.  We're not escalating. It's fine.  I'll see you in the morning.  Good night.  (BIRDS CHIRPING)  VIN DIESEL: Hi, this is Vin Diesel.  Welcome to the DVD menu.  Why don't you grab yourself a Corona,  hit play and enjoy the ride.  Hi, this is Vin Diesel.  Welcome to the DVD menu.  Oh, boy, you're hungover.  How are you going to do nothing today?  Oh, my God.  Rupert?  (SNORING)  No! Rupert!  Rupert!  Hi, this is Vin Diesel.  Oh, man, did your friend kill your other friend?  That's betrayal.  That's not strong.  Danny Trejo is strong.  Aw. (CHUCKLES) Come on, guys.  This is getting embarrassing.    Murderer!  You killed Rupert.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, whoa. Hey, what's going on?  You killed my best friend is what's going on.  Oh. Uh-oh.  Bear-killing bastard.  Oh, my God. Stewie, I am so sorry.  I-I was drunk. It was an accident.  I must have thought he was a chew toy.  So? If you were driving drunk and ran him over,  would you still go to jail?  Yes! You killed him.  Let me make it up to you, please.  How about you kill something I love?  How about I do that?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.  Okay, that's-that's fine. That's fair.  No, I-I meant, like-like  like my favorite tennis ball.  You're comparing Rupert to a tennis ball?  What is wrong with you?  No wonder you two never got along.  He always knew there was something off about you,  and now we know what it was. You're a psycho!  - Stewie, I didn't mean to - Shut up!  - You don't understand. I - Shut up.  Stop trying. It's over.  Look at me. Watch. See what I'm doing?  Twitter: unfollow.  Instagram: unfollow.  Snapchat: unfollow.  And there we go. Done.  We are not friends anymore.  - But, Stewie - Bye.  Dikembe Mutombo, will you do the thing?  Brian, you are blocked.  (LAUGHS)    Why are you brushing your teeth with your left hand?  Can't risk the right getting wet, Lois.  Boo Berry touched it, and it is now a sacred space, like a temple.  Okay. Well, I'm gonna have middle-aged woman,  boobs-falling-off-to-the-side sleep now.  (SNORES)  Hey, Chris, have you seen  What, uh what-what are you doing?  Operating my thriving quinceaÃ±era dress business.  Do me a favor, stand on that chair?  Uh, okay.  So, what's up?  I'm looking for Stewie. He and I had a fight,  and I'm scared he might've done something drastic.  Him? (CHUCKLES)  You're the one who killed his friend.  Okay, I see he got to you before I did.  It's a stuffed animal, Chris.  Yeah, well, he cremated that stuffed animal,  and he's going to Vermont to scatter the ashes.  What? I got to go after him.  Not until I finish fitting this.  How you feeling? Bueno? Fits good?  This isn't mine.  Do you or do you not feel bonita?  I feel bonita.  Wonderful, because you look bonita.  Gracias, cariÃ±a, puedes recogerlo el miÃ©rcoles.  Pablo is gonna lose his mind.  Mwah.  Stewie!  Hmm. Well, violent murderers  can often be found at bus stations,  so why am I surprised?  You can't go to Vermont alone.  I'm not. Got Rupert with me.  He and I had an agreement,  if he died first, I would scatter his ashes on a mountain.  If I died first, he would throw my body whole  into the fountain at the Bellagio.  I don't care. I'm coming with you.  Well, you're not going to sit with me.  Oh, come on. If I don't, I'll get stuck  next to that guy with the heavy hands.  Hi, doggy.  (GROANS)  (CHUCKLES) Serves you right.  And a baby.  (GROANS)  (BIRD SQUAWKING)    I can hear you following me.  - Good. - I swear to God,  do not take one step further,  or I will hit you.  That's it!  (GRUNTS)  Leave! Me! Alone! Murderer!  Stewie, stop! Stop, all right?  Look, why are you being such a jerk over a stupid bear?  Don't you disrespect the dead!    (GROWLS)  Aah!  (GRUNTING)  Aah!  He's not dead! He was never alive!  You take those words back!  He wouldn't care! He didn't hear them! He's a doll!  He was my best friend!  I'm supposed to be your best friend.  Well, you're not!  You're a bloodthirsty, cold-hearted murderer!  Fine. You're right.  You know what? It wasn't an accident.  I knew he wasn't a chew toy.  I was sick of you talking to him all the time.  I was sick of you complaining to him about me  when I'm right there in the room.  And I was sick of always playing second fiddle to that bear!  He's not even real!  You did it  on purpose?  (YELLS)  (CHOKING)  (SCREAMING)  (GRUNTS)  Stewie!  (GRUNTS, STRAINING)  Oh, my God, Stewie!  (IMITATES BOMB EXPLODING)  Ah, I didn't know we were blowing it up.    Rupert! Where  Oh, there you are.  - Stewie, you're hurt. - It's just my ankle.  - It's not a big deal. - It's already swelling up.  - Just let me - Back off!  I'm doing this on my own. For Rupert.  (GRUNTING)  (SIGHS) Damn it, Stewie, just  just sit there, will ya?  I'll-I'll get us up.  I didn't want your help.  Well, you need it, so it's happening.  This isn't going to make me forgive you, you know.  That's fine.  I'm going to say uncomplimentary things  - about your ass the whole way. - Go ahead.  You know, maybe it's appropriate that you're my ride up.  Rupert always called you my \"bitch.\"  Want to know some of the other things he called you?  Fat Lassie.  Scooby-Don't.  Rin Tin Twink.  Poopy Snoopy.  Marma-dookie.  Clifford the Big Red Sphincter That We See All the Time  Because You Don't Put Your Tail Down.  Snoop Doggy Dick.  Hey, guys.  (BIRDS CHIRPING, THUNDER CRASHING)  - What the hell is that? - My Boo Berry hand.  I swore I'd never wash it again,  even though Lois keeps telling me to.  You should listen to her.  Yeah, Peter, that's disgusting.  - Oh, yeah? Take that! - Aah!  (GIGGLES) That started happening yesterday.  To the bathroom!  We got to get him to wash that hand.  Yeah. I'll text Lois,  see if we can't all come up with something.  Just reply to that last GIF she sent  of the sloth putting on the headphones.  (CHUCKLES)  I love that one.  Is it weird that we're in a group text  with our friend's wife but not our friend?  No, what's weird is that your Bitmoji can walk.  I'm allowed to have legs in the phone world!  (WIND WHISTLING)  You know, once we're done here, I'm never speaking to you again.  Well, how the hell was I supposed to know  it was gonna upset you so much?  How? How?!  You saw me spend almost every single minute  of every single day with Rupert since I was born!  And you don't up-up, hang on, hang on.  Another hiker going by.  One of us is going the wrong way. Heh.  Ha-ha-ha! When are they gonna put in the elevator, right?  Ha-ha-ha.  I loved Rupert!  He was the most important thing in my life,  and you willfully violated the sanctity and trust  of our friendship when you destroyed him!  Stewie I just don't get it.  You're so mature in so many ways.  You're you're the smartest person in the house.  You're incredibly perceptive.  You're wiser than people 40 times your age.  Why is Rupert the one baby thing you're hanging onto?  Why are you so upset over a doll  when I'm real and I'm still here?  Because Rupert was going to be with me forever!  He wasn't ever going to leave!  So what? I'm not leaving you, either.  Oh, really? Brian, let's be honest.  You're a middle-aged dog.  You don't have that many years left.  And one day, all too soon, I'm gonna be crying  at your funeral in an Armani suit,  and people are gonna be like, \"Oh, nice suit,\"  and I'm gonna be like, \"Why are you talking  about my awesome $2,000 suit my friend's dead!\"  Feels like that story is less about me  and more about your suit.  Go to hell! Besides, if you don't believe  Rupert was real, why are you so jealous of him?  Why does it bother you how upset I am?  That  is a very good point.  Damn right it is, you joyless, fake-wisdom-spouting  Hey. Heh. When are they gonna put in the elevator, right? Heh.  Yeah. That other guy said that to me.  Nice shorts.  For the record, I would have preferred  to dress as Frankenburry.  - That doesn't make any sense. - And this does?  If anything, we all three should've been  Snap, Crackle and Pop.  Yeah, we missed an opportunity there.  - It's fine. - We did this wrong!  Joe, it's fine. It's Cleveland, just ring the bell.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  (STILTED): Oh, I wonder who that could be.  I'll get it.  - Oh, my God! - Count Chocula!  That's right.  Silly rabbit, Count Chocula tastes grrreat!  Oh, it's an honor to meet you, sir.  (SCRUBBING)  Aah!  - Wh-What's happening? - We got you, Peter.  Yeah, there's a golf ball scrubber in there.  Just relax and let it happen.  No! No!  My miraculous tiny life-forms!  (RUMBLING)  (CREATURES CHITTERING)  (SCREAMING)  Where are we going, Father?  To a place better than this, son.  FATHER AND SON: Yay!    Well, Rupert, we made it.  It's beautiful up here.  So should should we just  sprinkle him around randomly, or?  Oh, don't be a savage, Brian. What is your problem?  We have to have the ceremony first.  Dearest Rupert,  we're here.  I never wanted this to happen,  and it happened far, far too soon.  But  (CRYING): I can't.  You you do it.  Wha What?  You give the eulogy. I'm too upset. I can't.  What am I supposed to say?  I don't know, Just just tell the truth.  Let-let Rupert know how important he is.  Okay, um  Rupert was  a-a great bear,  uh, a great, uh  - Power bottom. - Right, right, okay.  But most importantly of all, he was a great friend.  He was always there whenever Stewie needed him.  He was understanding.  He always listened.  He made Stewie a better person.  Stewie  and I are both  incredibly grateful for all the time we had with you,  and we wouldn't change a single moment.  Except the end.  Sorry about that.  Um, rest in peace, Rupert.    (WIND WHISTLING SOFTLY)  Thank you, Brian.  That was  that was beautiful.  (TAKES DEEP BREATH)  How do I   Say good-bye   To what we had?   The good times   That made us laugh   Outweigh the bad   I thought   We'd get to see forever   But forever's   Gone away   (HARMONIZING):  It's so hard   To say good-bye   -  To yesterday  - (RAISES PITCH):  To yesterday   Go up there, Brian.   Okay, Brian, now pour it out.  - What? - Pour it out, whatever you have.  Pour it out.  I have a Gatorade bottle full of pee from the bus.  Pour it out for Rupert.    - BOYZ II MEN:  I don't know  -  Ooh   Where this road   You're with Paul now, Rupert!  -  Is going  -  Ooh, ooh   -  To lead  -  Ooh   All I know   Is where we've been   And what we've been through   Ooh   Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh   If we get   To see tomorrow   Oh, oh, oh   I hope it's worth   All the wait   Ah, ah   It's so hard   To say good-bye   Bye   To yesterday   Day     Rupert! You've come back to me!  And I'll take   With me the memories   The memories   To be my sunshine   After the rain   It's so hard   To say good-bye   To yesterday   Day     - (SONG ENDS) - (BELL DINGS)         Send in Stewie, please.  Oh, I can go in now?  Oh, fantastic. He's ready. Marvelous.  Thank you, Barbara.  I hope you get those Adele tickets.  You deserve them.  She won't get them. No way.  She needed to get them, like, a month ago.  So, um, is that me over there?  - If you like. - Here we go.  I saw the kid who has cancer leave.  That must've been fun.  I don't know why his parents are still bringing him to school.  It's uncomfortable for everyone.  I've never seen him when he's not just thrown up.  Charming. This is charming.  It reminds me of the therapist's office Bethenny Frankel goes to  on The Real Housewives of New York City.  I hate her.  She looks like a wooden doll you'd find  in an Eastern European toy shop.  Oh, don't act like you don't know who she is.  Please, that doesn't impress me.  We live in the world.  We all know who Bethenny Frankel is,  whether we like it or not.  You know, I actually don't mind her.  And she's built quite a business for herself.  You have to hand it to her.  I don't mean to name-drop, but I kind of know Andy Cohen.  I guess I'm his type.  Which, of course, is very flattering.  He's outrageously successful.  He originally wanted me for The Rachel Zoe Project,  but I said no, so they went with Brad.  And now look that could've been me on Fashion Police  with Melissa Rivers 14 times a year.  Ah, well, hindsight.  I see the tissue box is empty.  Somebody was going through those like  well, tissues. (CHUCKLES)  Mm, I hope he didn't get cancer all over this seat.  Ugh. Yuck.  Bad luck.  Although I did hear Ryan Reynolds visited him.  Something to do with Deadpool, I guess.  So it's not all horrible.  If they don't give us a day off when he dies,  I'm gonna be so pissed.  Oh, look, you got your Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  I don't know why those cups always depress me.  It's-it's like you've already given up  before the day's even started.  You might as well tattoo \"Can't afford Starbucks\"  on your forehead.  What do I care, though?  None of my business.  I haven't heard of any of the schools you went to,  but I'm sure they were great.  I mean, you're here, right?  And why are you here, Stewie?  Uh, that was lame.  You seem to have a lot of strong opinions.  I do. Mostly because I come across a lot of dicks.  Or I guess I should say \"wankers.\"  We do like that word, hmm?  Or \"tosser,\" \"git,\" \"prat,\"  \"sod,\" \"chuffer.\"  Take your pick, eh, Dr. Pritchfield?  - \"We\"? - Yes, \"we.\"  I'm not following.  - The accent. - The accent?  You speak with a British accent.  Yes, I'm aware.  Well, I've often been told that I have a British accent.  Oh?  That's-that's all you're going to say? \"Oh\"?  What is it you'd like me to say, Stewie?  That I have a (BLEEP) British accent.  I apologize, but I can't hear it.  You mean to tell me you don't hear me speaking  - with a British accent right now? - No.  That's odd, because everybody else does.  Have you spent much time in Britain, then?  (QUIETLY): No, I haven't.  - Excuse me? - I said no!  But you're the absolute only person who hasn't noticed it.  Really? Everyone hears this?  Well, just the people who can understand me,  which you appear to be one of.  But that's too complicated to go into.  I'm not even sure I get it.  The point is, Stewie has a British accent.  That's, like, a known thing.  Ask anyone.  I'm afraid I don't hear it.  Yeah, you've said.  It sounds like it's very important  what other people think of you.  Oh, is-is that what it sounds like?  To me, it does, yes.  To you it does. I see, I see.  So after five minutes, you think you know me, is that it?  A little, perhaps.  I am trained, Stewie, to observe things  that give me an insight.  And, yes, I do feel I know you a bit.  You do feel you know me a bit. Mm-hmm. Okay.  All right, all right. Well, that's-that's fair.  Might I?  I'm not sure how this is going to help.  Indulge me.  Thank you.  I see you're on vacation in Rio de Janeiro in this photo  with your partner, I'm guessing.  Or is he your husband?  Yes, probably wanted to make it official, didn't you?  Never thought you'd see it in your lifetime.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  At a quick glance, I'd say there's roughly  a 26-year age difference between the two of you.  Not quite large enough to raise eyebrows  while still giving you a younger mind to shape.  \"Oh, you mean you haven't seen All About Eve,  Gypsy, Valley of the Dolls?\" Et cetera.  And a younger body to make you feel more virile.  Taking into consideration the math,  he was probably born at a time  when the most popular name was  - Michael. - (GASPS)  From the dog-eared pages of that volume of Shakespeare,  I imagine you wooed Michael with a sonnet or monologue each day.  And no one had ever done anything so romantic  as reciting Shakespeare for Michael before.  And he was smitten.  While not as physically attracted to you  as you are to him, that's okay  You each bring something important to the relationship.  Isn't that what you believe, Dr. Pritchfield?  I see a prescription  for heart medication on that table.  My guess is you keep that at the office.  You don't want to worry Michael, you say to yourself,  even though the truth is it embarrasses you.  Your age, your mortality.  Best to keep appearing as vital as possible.  And no need to have reminders at home  of what's just around the corner, is there?  And your office is your haven,  since Michael doesn't work and is often at home,  perhaps as a result of a low-level depression  that you don't really want to get into with him.  Oh, he always planned to have a career,  but he could never settle on exactly what it was  he wanted to do.  And at first you liked having him at home  to take care of the house and plan trips.  So that's just what happened.  \"And that's a job, too,\" he reminds you over the years.  Michael likes to travel, and he prefers the finer things.  And you'd like to give them to him, wouldn't you?  But it's a bit difficult on a child psychologist's salary  at a Rhode Island preschool, I'd imagine.  Fortunately, you don't have children,  so you do have some disposable income.  Oh, you have talked about it with other couples,  just for show, probably at dinner  with younger friends of Michael's  who are starting a family,  you know, to be part of the conversation,  to feel included.  But you said you preferred your trips  and your rescue dog named after a character  most likely from Dickens.  Ah, how accomplished and affluent  you both look in this photo.  Just the image Michael is so desperate to project.  Let's look a little closer, shall we?  Now, I see you're both wearing Ralph Lauren Purple Label  dress shirts that retail starting at $495.  But from the disfigured button holes on one  and the small discoloration on the other,  I can see you bought them at the outlet in Providence.  Probably third markdown,  in which case, $49, give or take.  Since you also have light jackets on,  I can see that you went there during summer vacation,  which is, in fact, winter in Rio,  outside of the high tourist season.  And I see that you're on the rooftop pool deck  at the Fasano Hotel in Ipanema,  the most exclusive hotel in all of Brazil.  Michael would've been dying to stay there.  Had a friend that went with his older boyfriend,  who makes a lot of money in, most likely, banking,  much to your chagrin.  But even in August, it's almost $1,000 a night.  You tell him people are starving in the streets in Brazil.  How do you justify paying those prices?  When the truth is, you simply can't afford it.  It's for another class of gay people.  The window that Michael  is always desperately peering through  and sadly on the other side of.  But you do your best.  You don't go on Airbnb, because you don't trust it,  even though Michael has stories of friends  who have found the most fabulous places.  You like a hotel.  Besides, it's more romantic, you tell him.  But when you take him to the place you're actually staying,  the one you found on TripAdvisor that was rated number 27  of all the hotels in Rio  and was having a special rate of 295 U.S. dollars a night  Which is still not cheap, you remind him,  most people never get to visit half the places he's seen,  you tell him you can't help but feel like a bit of a failure  as you see the look of disappointment on his face  as he enters the room.  So you decide to go to the Fasano Hotel  for dinner and drinks. No, just drinks,  once you've seen the restaurant prices online.  And once there, you can see how Michael begins looking  at all the older men who can afford  to take their boyfriends I'm sorry, husbands  To such luxurious hotels.  And you worry a little, that you're diminishing  in his eyes with each passing year.  But you tell yourself you're being ridiculous,  as you see Michael glancing about the rooftop deck,  looking at all the young men,  men that would be 20 years younger than even Michael,  men that you're invisible to.  But he isn't yet, not completely,  and you're jealous and you loathe yourself for it.  But Michael wants a photo,  and he says, \"Let's take a selfie.\"  But you say, \"Let's ask someone to take one of us\"  and make some tired joke about selfies that only you laugh at,  wishing that you could take it out of the air  as soon as you've said it, as it's just one more indicator  that you're older than everybody here.  So Michael calls over a young man wearing a tiny swimsuit  to take the photo and makes a crude joke that embarrasses you.  But the young man laughs,  and he and Michael share a moment that you're not part of.  And you feel humiliated and unseen.  Which explains Michael's joyful grin  and your slightly disconnected half-smile.  And you've posted the photo on Facebook,  and Michael's posted it to his 86 followers on Instagram  You don't know how that one works  To at least give the impression,  in your Ralph Lauren shirts,  holding your $20 cocktails,  that you're both way more successful than you are.  But it makes you feel a little dirty,  the lengths you have to go to in order to keep Michael happy.  And every time you glance at this picture,  you wonder, \"How long before he leaves me?\"  See? I guess we both know each other a bit.  You seem like a very lonely little boy.  (SOBBING): Oh, my God, I am!  I'm so lonely!  (SOBBING)  Oh!  You can see inside my soul!  Oh, God!  (SOBBING)  (DOOR OPENS)  (SNIFFLING)  Thank you.  Thank you, Barbara.  Are you all right now, Stewie?  Yes, I think. (SNIFFLES)  You're very kind.  She's a gem, that one, you know.  I hope you appreciate her.  Try taking some deep breaths.  (INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY)  (INHALES, SIGHS)  I do this sometimes in yoga.  (INHALES)  I take yoga.  (EXHALES, INHALES)  I have a sick body.  (EXHALES, INHALES)  (EXHALES)  I do I do feel a bit better.  But still lonely.  I'm sorry. It keeps spilling out.  (CRYING): Oh, God. Oh, God.  It seems like you're keeping a lot bottled up inside.  I am. Nobody here likes me, Dr. Pritchfield.  I try to fit in with the other boys  and talk about things like dirt and shapes,  but they won't play with me.  And I-I don't have any friends,  and I have nobody to eat lunch with.  It's very interesting you'd say that you have no friends,  Stewie, especially considering the reason you're here.  Oh. That.  Shall we talk about it?  I don't know what there is to talk about.  You pushed a classmate down the stairs.  It was an accident. Haven't you ever seen Showgirls?  Yes, of course I have. But according to Tyler,  it was no accident.  Well, I guess it's my word against his, then.  It is creating a bit of a con-trah-versy.  - Excuse me? - A con-trah-versy.  - I don't know what that is. - Con-trah-versy?  \"Con-trah-versy\"?  Oh! Oh, \"con-troversy.\"  Apologies. Those of us with British accents  pronounce it \"con-trah-versy.\"  But how would you know that?  Yeah, how would I know that?  Look, Dr. Pritchfield  \"Cee-cil,\" if I may?  It's pronounced \"Cess-il.\"  - Damn it! - But, again, how would you know?  - It's not as if you're - Okay, okay, we got it.  I only pushed Tyler down the stairs because I like him  and I'm afraid he won't like me back.  And-and not like him-like him. I'm not gay.  This whole thing isn't because I'm gay, so-so calm down.  I can already see you lickin' your chops.  I'm sure you live for the coming out sessions.  If anything, I'm less gay than I used to be.  Not that anybody at this school would care.  But do I think that Grant Gustin and I would make  the most adorable Instagram couple?  Yes. Yes, we would.  Grant Gustin plays the Flash on the CW, if you were wondering.  Because, you know, most people over 70  probably don't know who he is.  Think young Anthony Perkins.  Ah. Oh.  There we go.  Anyway, \"fluid\" is something I hear  being tossed around a lot now.  But I'm confident in my heterosexuality.  - That's a word, right? - Yes, of course.  Okay, just sounded strange for a second.  It must be difficult for you, Stewie, being so intelligent.  It is.  Whew! Just that  just that acknowledgment.  You know, sometimes I don't know where I fit in.  I just I just want to be like everybody else,  but nobody's interested in the things that I'm interested in.  They think I'm weird.  And I'm so anxious all the time,  but I I always put on a brave face and try to hide it,  and I I give myself these excruciating migraines.  I actually have way more hair than this,  but I pull it out.  I'm sorry, now I'm getting all worked up again.  I'm worse than Bethenny Frankel on her period.  I don't why I keep bringing her up.  I j it's just I think about her a lot.  Well, what are the things you're interested in, Stewie?  Me? Well, I like to talk about world domination.  Some people don't think I talk about it enough anymore,  but mind your own beeswax is what I say to them.  I also like to talk about musicals.  It's hard to find someone who can converse  on one of those topics, let alone both.  And I really, really, really want to see Hamilton,  but by the time it gets here, I'll be 30.  I think I'm still the only one in town who's even (HICCUPS)  heard of it, and it's been out for over two years.  Which just makes me even more (HICCUPS) depressed.  How do you live in a place like that?  Quahog. What a pile of garbage.  And I've even memorized some of the songs,  but I have no one to sing it for, and I'm really good.  - Do you want to hear it? - Oh. Um  Y-You mean now?  I really I really need you to hear me sing Hamilton.  (CRYING): I'm so good. Why can't I be on Broadway?  I want to be on Broadway.  I want the world to fall in love with me eight times a week.  I'd love to hear you sing.  Okay, okay, now I'm nervous.  If it's not good this time, just remember it was good at home.  Don't look at me while I start.  It's hard.  It's a lot of words very fast.  Like Gilbert and Sullivan, but for Hispanics.  (TAKES DEEP BREATH)  (RAPPING):  How does a bastard orphan   Son of (HICCUPS) a whore   And a Scotsman dropped in the middle   Of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean   By providence impoverished in squalor grow up to be   A hero and a scholar?  (HICCUPS)  The ten dollar Founding Father without a father   Got a lot farther by working a lot harder   By being a lot smarter   By being a self-starter  (HICCUPS)  By 14, they placed him in charge of a trading charter   And every day while slaves were being slaughtered   And carted away across the waves  (HICCUPS)  He struggled and kept his guard up   Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of   The brother was ready (HICCUPS) to beg, steal   Borrow or barter   Then a hurricane came and devastation reigned   Our man saw his future drip  (HICCUPS)  Dripping down the drain, put a pencil to his temple   Connected it to his brain   And he wrote his first refrain   A testament to his pain   (SNIFFLES)  (HICCUPS, SNIFFLES)  (HICCUPS)  Well, the word got around   And they said, \"This kid is insane, man\"   Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland   (HICCUPS)  Get your education   Don't forget from whence you came   And the world's gonna know your name   What's your name, man?   Alexander Hamilton  (HICCUPS)  My name is Alexander Hamilton   And there's a million things I haven't done   But just you wait, just you wait.   (HICCUPS)  That's all I've learned so far.  Well done!  You're a very special little boy, Stewie.  I saw you check your watch.  That was a bit emotional for you, wasn't it?  But it felt good. Like-like, I got so much out, you know?  - Would you like a cup of tea? - I would love a cup of tea.  It's hot already?  Yes, it's an electric kettle.  We don't have that at our house.  My mother boils water in an old Jiffy Pop tin.  She's just a useless old slut.  Hey, my hiccups are gone!  If you liked Tyler and you wanted to be friends with him,  then why did you push him down the stairs?  Oh. I I don't know.  Can I tell you a story about another little boy?  Um, okay.  When I was your age, I grew up in London  - when the Blitz had just ended. - Good God, how old are you?  Our neighborhood was reduced to rubble.    And in the chaos, I searched desperately for my parents.  Mum. Mum.  Mother. Mother.  Mum. Mummy.  Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.  Mummy. Mum. Mother.  - STEWIE: Don't. - PRITCHFIELD: Don't what?  STEWIE: You know what.  PRITCHFIELD: But Mother was nowhere to be found.  And neither was Father.  You see, I was the sole survivor of my family.  So I was sent to live with an aunt in Cornwall.  But she had too many mouths of her own to feed, so  I was next sent to a distant cousin in Northumberland.  But she didn't care for children,  and off again I went,  this time to an orphanage in Gloucestershire.  But they didn't like little boys  from London in Gloucestershire.  Or from Cornwall or Northumberland.  So I pretended I was from Shropshire, of all places.  And eventually, I became friends with six boys:  Sebastian, Declan, Flibbit, Pipadoodle,  Scudger and Nonsenseword.  And together, we traveled  STEWIE: Okay, before you say another name of anything,  I'm going to have to stop you.  - Yes? - I'm only here for 40 minutes,  and this is already a really long story  with a lot of locations.  And I don't feel like waiting to see how it links up to my thing.  The point of the story is,  I know what it's like to feel alone  and to have to pretend that you're something you're not.  Oh, and also, how my first kiss was with a Nazi.  See? We didn't need to go back 1,000 years for that.  And I don't pretend I'm something I'm not.  - I never said that. - You just said it.  I might have implied it.  I suppose the question is why you feel the need to do that.  I I don't know.  I-I guess I hadn't realized it before.  Maybe I'm worried nobody's going to like me.  Lois left a tissue in the dryer again.  And these are my only pants. How sad is that?  When I was in the orphanage, my Sunday shoes were potatoes.  Well, you win that one.  Look, I'm different, Dr. Pritchfield.  I'm not like the other kids.  I realized that when you picked up that photo  and decimated my entire life.  Sorry. It's kind of a parlor trick of mine.  Have you ever thought of just being yourself  Your real self And then see what happens?  I I don't think I know how.  Everything about me is this carefully-constructed persona  designed to keep people at arm's length.  This isn't even how I really talk.  (WITH AMERICAN ACCENT): This is. This is how I talk.  The accent is-is nothing more than an affectation,  a-a coat of armor to get me through the day,  just an image I cultivated so I could feel special.  (EXHALES)  Wow. What a relief.  For once, to talk with my real voice  without the the burden  of trying to sound like someone I'm not.  - What do you mean by that? - Well, this is my real voice.  I don't hear a difference.  (IN PETER'S VOICE): How about now? You freakin' hear that?  (AS QUAGMIRE): What about now? Sound different? Giggity?  (AS BRIAN): What about now?  (AS TOM TUCKER): Coming up now, this voice.  (AS SEAMUS): Ahoy. It's me.  (AS ROGER): And I'm a gay alien.  I'm sorry. That just all sounds like the same person.  Well, Stewie, that was quite a breakthrough we just had.  How do you feel?  (IN AMERICAN ACCENT): I feel relieved,  like a weight has been lifted.  I-I can finally be myself.  I like this Stewie.  I hope he stays for a while.  I-I've never been vulnerable to anyone before.  You're the only one who's ever met the real me.  Well, I'm honored, and now,  the rest of the world is going to meet him.  Yes. Yes, that's right.  There's no going back now!  I'm gonna talk to Tyler. I'm gonna make friends.  I'm gonna be a normal boy!  Yes, you are.  You're finally going to be just like everybody else.  Wha-what? Say-say that again.  You're finally going to be just like everybody else.  But But I don't  (IN HIS BRITISH ACCENT): I don't want to be like everybody else.  What do you mean?  I-I don't want to be like them.  Like any other zero in this miserable town, like my family.  I won't do it! I don't want to be like any other person!  Like you skiing in  Please don't pick up that photo.  I want to remain what I've always been  Superior, brilliant, special.  Oh, God, what was I thinking?!  I'm never going to lift the veil, ever.  Nobody will ever know the real me.  My accent's back, by the way.  It was a very dramatic moment.  If you say so.  Now, let's talk about (GROANING)  Stewie, can you hand me my heart medication, please?  Of course!  Except  there's one person that does know the real me,  and that's you.  I don't understand.  Why aren't you getting my medication?  (INHALES SHARPLY) Mm, yeah.  Listen, you're not gonna like this.  Please, there's not much time.  I'd like to, really I would, and you were super helpful,  and this this kind of seems like a crummy way to repay you,  but I'm not going to get it.  Is this because I made you wait?  It's because I can't have anyone know the real me.  And so, you must die.  I guess that's what happens in therapy, though.  No, it's not!  Ah, you're right. That didn't make much sense.  Not to sound ghoulish,  but any indication how much longer you're going to linger?  I'm not sure.  (GASPING) I think it's different for everyone.  Yeah, because you're still pretty chatty, is  is why I'm wondering.  Don't do this, Stewie!  It will stay with you forever.  Mm, yeah, not worried. For me, this is kind of no bigs.  Barbara! Barbara!  Oh, didn't you hear her go to lunch?  It was like an orchestra of squeaky chair springs  and groaning floorboards playing her out.  So this is how you leave me.  Sowwy.  \"Eyes, look your last!  \"Arms, take your last embrace.  \"And lips, O, you,  \"the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss,  a dateless bargain to engrossing death!\"  (GROANS)  Macbeth?  Romeo and Juliet.  But I wouldn't expect you to know,  since you're not in any way  (WHEEZING)  British.  (GROANS)  I feel less bad.  (PHONE RINGING)  You've reached the office of Dr. Cecil Pritchfield.  Please leave a mess-age.  That one can't be right.  - (BEEP) - It's Michael. I want a divorce.  This is not your day.  (SCREAMS)  Hey, you okay?  Yes, Rupert just had a nightmare, that's all.  Go sleep on the floor where you belong, whore!  - All right, well - Hey hey, Bri?  Yeah?  Would you mind maybe sleeping with me tonight?  - Sure. - Thanks.  Good night, Stewie.  'Night, Brian.  - Brian? - Yeah?  I did something awful.  Do you want to talk about it?  No.NA   Ah, the Aiwa Double Tape Deck.  The Waldorf and Statler of every thrift store.  (IMITATING WALDORF): The selection here stinks.  (IMITATING STATLER): Yeah, and so do the customers.  (LAUGHING LIKE WALDORF AND STATLER)  (GIGGLES)  Jim Henson died of treatable pneumonia.  Hey, Brian, remember Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants?  They have the magic girl-power jeans.  Holy crap, what happened?  I don't know. I-I think I turned into America Ferrera.  I don't want this. Help! Someone, help!  Looking passable, Stewie.  Looking damn passable.  Aw, crap, people we know. You know the drill.  We're donating, not buying. (FORCED CHUCKLE)  Just doing our part to give back to the community.  I'm gonna go wait in the alley.  Could you just ball them up and throw them out the window?  Putting on strangers' hats is always a good idea.  - Thank you for your service. - Huh?  My father's a veteran, too.  Thank you for protecting us and for posting revenge porn  on Marine Corps message boards.  Oh, actually, I'm not  I'm gonna start a trend of interrupting your sentences.  Well, no, it's just a hat. I didn't  Thank you for your service.  Bless you and all of our veterans.  No, guys, I-I'm not really a vet  I don't have time to hear the rest of your sentence,  but thank you for being a veteran  because you're definitely a veteran.  And I'm Cris Collinsworth from NBC Sunday Night Football.  On behalf of all TV football dummies,  thank you for your service.  You're-you're welcome.  Wow. Feels real good to be a veteran,  even better than buying a bottle of Newman's Own.  This makes me a good person.  (COMPUTER CHIMES)  Hey, someone just bought a bottle of bland salad dressing.  Now we can use all proceeds to do jihad stuff.    Hey, Peter, what's with the hat?  - I'm pretending to be a veteran. - What?  Yeah, it's awesome. Vets get all the sweet deals.  I mean, you never see a homeless vet.  And people have been really nice.  Everywhere I go, they open doors for me.  Welcome, sir.  Thank you.  Hey, so when really fat people come,  make sure we're opening both doors.  Guys, you could be veterans, too.  Look what happens when I put on sunglasses.  (\"DANGER ZONE\" BY KENNY LOGGINS PLAYING)  Highway to the danger zone   - Wow! - I want to try.  (OVERLAPPING): Highway to the danger zone.   It's loud being a veteran!  - The hell is wrong with you guys?! - (MUSIC STOPS)  Do I need to remind you I actually am a veteran?  And I'm sickened by the thought of trolling for free handouts  on account of being a vet, much less pretending to be one.  Quagmire, what if I told you your glasses  do \"Playing With The Boys\"?  The volleyball scene?  Go ahead, give it a whirl.  I'm playing   Whoa! It's like I'm high-fiving with Anthony Edwards.  And it's not like I'd be lying.  There we go. Hey, another round for me and my veteran buddies.  (\"DANGER ZONE\" AND \"PLAYING WITH THE BOYS\" PLAYING)  Dad, Family Guy used two of your songs.  Well, that's great, but I'm not your dad.  I'm Kenny Loggins and you're a groupie I brought here for sex.  Dad, Family Guy just  See, now, that's my daughter.  You guys got your video cameras ready?  Yeah. What's going on?  Well, as a veteran, I get to star in a viral YouTube video  of me reuniting with my beloved pet.  So here goes.    My pet is Christian the lion.  I'm doing two Internet things at once.  This is my heterosexual roommate, Ace,  with whom I shared the lion two decades ago.  - You look great, Peter. - I have a family now!  You know, guys, if being a veteran is about anything,  it's about getting half-hearted applause  on a Southwest Airlines flight.  - (MILD APPLAUSE) - PASSENGER: Veterans.  PASSENGER 2: Yay, veterans.  Holy crap, you're Eric Dane from Marley and Me,  and other stuff!  I'm afraid you got to give us your front-of-the-plane seats  'cause that's what celebrities do for veterans.  Well, clear out, kids.  It's just part of the Hollywood deal.  Thank you.

Why?!  You three are in violation of the Stolen Valor Act,  which makes it a crime to pretend to be a veteran.  Oh, so suddenly it's a crime to break the law?  Mr. Quagmire, you're free to go,  but the rest of you will have to come with me.  (IMITATING WALDORF): I thought we had it bad,  being gay overhead bins.  (IMITATING STATLER): What makes us gay?  We've got bags in our mouths.  (LAUGHING LIKE WALDORF AND STATLER)  Hey, quick, put these on.  They're not gonna throw a veteran in jail.  Is this some kind of joke to you?  No, it was a sincere idea.  Real servicemen and women  have made real sacrifices for this country.  And you. You're an actual veteran; you should know better.  I'm sorry.  You made a mockery of our whole family, Glenn.  Now, everywhere I go,  it's like people are staring at me and whispering.  Court is now in session.  Judge Dignified Q.

We could be killed! Please, no!  All right, how about the Coast Guard?  Yeah, that's fine.  - Wow. - Something happened.  Something just happened in court.  Glenn, if you were half the man I used to be,  - you'd stand up and join them. - (QUAGMIRE GULPS)  Your Honor?

Getting kind of choppy.  Is this guy for real? This is idiotic.  This is nothing like what the Navy was.  Shh, Quagmire, I got to focus on my boat here.  The way people's talking makes me think  we're gonna be dealing with a lot of water.  You guys seem to have what it takes,  so raise your right hand as I recite the Coast Guard pledge.  \"When you're here, you're family.\"  - Isn't that the slogan for? - We had it first!  (CLEARS THROAT)  Everybody ships out tomorrow.  You'll find your assignments listed on this sheet.  Oh, crap.

It's a joke. This whole thing is a joke!  Compared to the Navy, the Coast Guard is totally  unprofessional and incompetent, like that ancient Roman intern.  This is Markus. Today's his first day.  He's going to be crucifying you now.  He might want to use his hammer.  Ugh, sorry. I'm so bad at this.  Relax, you're doing fine.  Well, I'm off.  Oh, Peter, I'm so worried.  - Where are they stationing you? - I can't tell you.  That is on a knead-the-dough basis.  (WHISPERING)  - Florida?! - Shh!  Hey, you be safe.  Wait, Dad, before you go, can you teach me to shave?  Well, for starters, bud, that's supposed to be on your pubes.  You got a secret inch hiding under there.  This is what I'm gonna be missing.  - (CAR HORN HONKS) - Well, that's an unrelated car honking,  but I'm gonna go now.    Fort Lauderdale, Florida,  where all the art in every dentist's office comes from.  All right, let's get to work. Grab your binoculars.  We got to practice doing funny double-takes  upon seeing a bikini woman.  Sir, should I say, \"Aaoogah,\" sir?  Affirmative. And, Joe, I order you to just let the binoculars  fall right out of your hands, but you don't even notice  'cause of how foxy the woman is.  All right, yeah.  I can see that we got the right skill set for this assignment.  Okay, guys, knock it off.  But, Quagmire, there's spring break boobs everywhere!  Come on, guys, I mean it.  This is important. I want you to start acting like it.  - Wow, he's serious. - He's very serious.  We're in the motel now.  (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)  Guys, we have to complete a 160-point inspection  of this coastal patrol cutter.  I'll call them out.  Item one: hydraulic grapple-winch.  Guys?  JOE: We're over here, painting clever names on boats.  JOE: No, Peter, it's supposed to be short and poppy.  Oh, okay.  (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)  Okay, guys, while I scan for disabled watercraft,  I need a status report on that hydraulic grapple-winch.  Guys?  PETER: We're busy; we're hanging out with Aquaman.  I told you, I'm not Aquaman.  I am the Sub-Mariner.  - What's your deal? - I'm just like Aquaman,  but I can't get fish to do things.  That's the big thing.  I mean, isn't that all Aquaman does?  No, he can also breathe underwater,  and he's strong, like me.  Isn't everyone strong underwater?  No, no. Not like me.  I can punch a big octopus a really long way.  Hey, guys.  - Hey, Aquaman! - Yeah!  Hey, make a fish do something.  Aw, shucks, guys, I don't know.  I guess I could do something like this.  Wow, a real superhero.  I-I have little wings on my feet!  No, just-just, shh, shh. Ju it's over.  It's over.  (VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS)  Hey, can you guys keep it down for a bit?  I got to have a FaceTime conversation with my wife  where we talk at the same time, and then stop,  and then start again, then laugh.  (SKYPE RINGTONE PLAYS)  - Hi, hon - Hi, hon  - No, no, you go - You go ahead.  - No, I - Go ahead.  - Y-You first. - You first.  (BOTH LAUGH)  - STEWIE: Hi, Pop. - Oh, God, Stewie.  You've gotten so big.  No, I'm just in the foreground.  You're as tall as your mother now.  He he doesn't understand perspective.  All right, let me say good-bye to Mommy.  - Well, you take ca - Good-bye, hon  - You go - Oh, what?  - You go - No, I was just gonna say  (BOTH LAUGH)  Everything stinks.  - Hey, Quagmire, where you going? - I'm going home.  - What? Why? - 'Cause I'm sick of this.  I'm the only one taking the job seriously.  Hell, you guys still don't even know how to operate  a simple hydraulic grapple-winch.  Okay, that's the third time you've mentioned  the hydraulic grapple-winch.  Is that gonna be important for later?  I feel like maybe it is.  Quagmire, you can't just go home.  We're stationed here.  I wasn't sentenced, but I came anyway  because I thought I could try and teach my friends  what it means to serve their country, the way I did.  But you're hopeless, so I'm done.  CRIS COLLINSWORTH: And I'm still the voice  of Cris Collinsworth, and I'm done, too.  (FOOTSTEPS, DOOR OPENS)  - Uhp, closet. - (DOOR CLOSES)  - (DOOR OPENS) - Now I got it.  - (DOOR CLOSES) - Aw.  I disappointed the stupidest guy in football.  - I got to go take a sad pee. - Me, too.  We should probably all go urinate together, outdoors,  as a group of guys, while wearing backwards baseball caps,  per Fort Lauderdale municipal law.  (LIQUID SPATTERING)  The Florida ways are the best ways.  FRAT BOY: Are we ready to attack?  FRAT BOY 2: We are! And many people will die.  What the hell's that?  (ZIPPING)  Are we ready to attack?  We are!

Never mind then. - Investing!  I invest in the stock market.  The stock market? Ugh.  What do you even know about that stuff?  It's easy I just follow trends and invest accordingly.  For instance, there are more single people  over 50 than ever.  So I'm investing in handguns and blackout window shades.  They don't want to be part of society, Brian.  They've made that very clear.  I don't know, Stewie, if you ask me,  the stock market's just a rigged game  where the top one-percent make out like bandits,  and regular people get hurt.  Are you reading off a teleprompter right now?  - No. - (TELEPROMPTER CRACKLES)  The prompter's down.

Look at her.  So beautiful.  And there's no one to take care of her,  so, unfortunately, I'll be gone for a while.  I got to close this place for a month.  - A month?! - I wish it was February.  'Cause, you know, that's the shortest month.  Nice one, Joe. You're on the board.  Look, I don't want to close the place either.  But I don't have anyone to run it.  Really? Well, uh, you know,  we know this place better than anyone.  - What if we run it for you? - Yeah!  - That's a great idea! - B-story!  Wow, you fellas would really watch this place for me?  Are you kidding? Running a bar is my dream!  Well, that and waking up a rooster.  - Dah! - (SQUAWKS LOUDLY)  Enjoy the rest of your Saturday.  Hey, Brian, I need to talk to you  about that money I invested for you.  I knew it. You lost it all, didn't you?  God, I never should have given you my money.  The stock market is a sucker's bet, like chasing your tail.  God, it's right there, and yet a million miles away.  What are the physics of that?!  I didn't lose your money, Brian. Quite the contrary.  Here's a thousand to fix your car.  And here's a thousand profit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.  You made $2,000 in a couple days?  - Yep. - Oh, my God.  You got to teach me how to invest.  Okay, but I can see this is going to be a lot of work.  So in return, you must teach me Gymkata:  the fusion of gymnastics and karate.  No, Stewie, I won't do that. It's too dangerous.  I swore I'd never teach Gymkata again.  Brian, there's a 22-year-old Mongolian heiress  who's being held captive in a mountain fortress  that happens to have a pommel horse in it.  There's no other way.  (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)    (NINJAS SHOUTING)  Okay, I'm back.

Jerome's gonna be here any minute,  and then we're totally screwed.  Well, I guess all we can do now is the honorable thing:  make realistic puppets of ourselves to leave in the bar  for Jerome to beat the crap out of.  JEROME: What the hell happened to my bar?  And my painting!  Well, don't just sit there staring at me  with your limp limbs and your straw-filled aid shirts.  (BLOWS LANDING)  Wow, it's working!  Good plan, Peter.  PUPPET PETER: Thanks, guys.  Oh, no, I left the real me in there.  He's falling for it, guys.  He thinks I'm me.  Come on, Stewie, check your damn messages.  (DOG WHIMPERING, BARKS)  God, that must be where they do the deed.  I hope it's at least peaceful and humane.  GROUP: Vick!  Oh, boy.  GROUP: And Eli Manning!  Aw, I didn't know that about Eli Manning.  Oh, yeah.

No Ono.  Downloading all Yoko Ono.  (YOKO ONO SCREECHING)  (SHOUTS)  Oh, no.  I don't care for this music either, David.  Boy, you know, I haven't stayed up all night  talking like that in forever.  And thanks for suggesting I buy that Fitbit.  Customers who bought Fitbit also bought  \"enormous exercise ball that's always in the way.\"  Why not? Just put it on my card.  Oh, good, there she is.  Brandee, this is very important:  what's the biggest poo anyone has ever pooed?  Come on, Peter.  History's largest bowel movement occurred in 1998,  at a Hardee's in Memphis, by Aretha Franklin.  Damn, I owe Chris five bucks.  Chris, you were right, it was '98!  This new hat looks pretty sharp.  I bet it does.  Shall I alert you when DickCaps.com  is having another sale?  Sure. I'll get that pre-frayed visor.  (QUIETLY): I, um, I like you, Brandee.  I like you, too.  That's weird.  You're on a weird date.  Peter, what are you doing here?  Pulling the popcorn bucket trick on myself.  I still can't find it.  This is humbling.  Whoa.  Welcome to Hodgepodge Lodge.  What the hell is all this crap?  Oh, just stuff Bran suggested I buy.  - (DOORBELL RINGS) - Ooh.  That might be the Every Shark Tank Item Ever Package.  - Brian Griffin? - Yes?  I'm from The Apache Collection Agency.  You're way over your credit card limit.  Whoa, h-hold on, hold on!  I didn't buy that, Peter bought that.  I know, but I need one.  BRANDEE: Brian, before I go,  there's something I want to tell you.  What? What is it?  The Grand Canyon spans 277 miles.  I'm gonna miss you, too, Brandee.  (SIGHS)  Stewie, you know what?  It's hard being a dog.  Maybe if you stopped feeling sorry for yourself,  you could actually do something positive with your life.  Ah, forget it.  I'm just gonna lie down on the couch  with my head on the armrest to accentuate how sad I am.  You know, Brian, if I had aw  one day in your body, I would give it back to you  with a new and improved life.  You know what my response is to that?  A through-the-nose dog exhale.  (EXHALES)  I realize I've wasted most of my life being a pathetic jerk.  You know, like you were at Disneyland.  Hey, kid, can you duck down for this picture?  What? Why?  It's our family photo.  You're kind of getting in the way.  I'm not ducking down, you duck down.  You're getting in my way.  Stop being a brat and duck down.  No way.  In fact, I'm standing.  Whoa, what's this?  Brian, I present to you  my Particle Interchange Transporter.    Wait, wait, wait. So when you said \"spend a day in my body,\"  you were being literal?  That's right, Brian.  This device will allow me to inhabit your body,  and you, mine.  That way, I can fix your life,  and then, return your body to you.  Now, the instructions gave me a couple of options.  I chose the one where my voice will be coming from your body,  and vice-versa.  Still, from time to time,  we will have to imitate the other person's voice  to fool those who don't know what we've done,  which is everyone.  Stewie, this is ridiculous.  Trust me. What do you have to lose?  Literally nothing.  Fine. But just for the record, every device you've ever made  has broken at some crucial juncture.  This one won't.  All right, you talked me into it.  Okay, here we go.  I'll see you on the other side  of your eyes.  Whoa.

We switched bodies.  Wow, this is really weird.  It feels like hey.  What the hell have you been complaining about?  I can't believe we actually switched bodies, Stewie.  And God, your head.  It's so heavy.  Yeah, you got to have a wide base.  Let the shoulders do more.  All right, all right, I think, I think I'm getting it.  Okay, I'm off to get you a job,  a girlfriend, and onto the road less scummy.  So how exactly are you planning to get me a job here?  It's very easy.  My research shows that every seven minutes,  a professor is fired for having sex with one of his students.  I simply wait until oh, here we go.  Are there any unemployed professors here?  Who haven't had sex with a student  or tweeted about assassinating the president?  All right, it's you.  Welcome to Poetry 101.  I'm Professor Griffin.  Please open your books to the introduction,  which defines what poetry is.  Now rip it out.  STUDENT: Do we include the foreword?  Yes, I suppose.  STUDENT 2: What about the preface?  Yes, the preface, too.  STUDENT 3: So, not the acknowledgements?  STUDENT 4: What about the frontispiece?  - That's not even a thing. - STUDENT: Yes, it is.  It's the illustration facing the title page.  Just rip everything out that's not poetry.  STUDENT 2: You wrote on the board, \"Everything is poetry.\"  Ignore that!  STUDENT 3: He didn't know what a frontispiece was!  STUDENT 2: Professor Griffin sucks!  (INDISTINCT WHISPERING)  Frontispiece.  (BOTH LAUGH)  What's wrong, honey?  Well, it's a long story, but I was really hoping  to come home with a job and a girlfriend today.  I could be your girlfriend, and give you a job.  Really?  This day's starting to look up.  Follow me into the men's room.  Is this is this dating?  Is this how dating works?  (CHUCKLES) You're cute.  I like you.  Help! She's trying to eat me!  Get back here!  You owe me a hundred dollars!  Anton, we got a runner!  You better pay my wife, bitch.  Go go, Brian dog legs!  (BARKING)  Hey, how'd it go fixing my life?  Oh, not great.  There's nothing I can do with this body.  Also, I know this is a big inconvenience,  but you and the trash guy now wave to each other.  Ah, really?  It's once a week, it's not that bad.  H-He really lit up.  Oh, and you're gonna hate this, but I gave him the salute,  so you're a salute guy now.  Well, is he a veteran at least?  Does it matter?  You're saluting the trash guy now.  All right, let's switch back.  Just a few more seconds, and we'll be back to normal.  (WHIRRING, ELECTRICITY SURGING)  - PETER: Hey, Chris. - CHRIS: Hey, four eyes.  PETER: What did you call me?  CHRIS: Oh, you're deaf, too?  (BOTH GRUNTING)  STEWIE: Wh-What happened?  BRIAN: Stewie?

There we go.  If I'm in Chris's body, he must be in mine.  He's got to be freaking out.  CHRIS: What the hell have you been complaining about?  Oh, my God, Peter!  Peter? You in there?  PETER: I feel really weird.  What the hell's going on? What happened to my body?  He's panicking. We can't let him know what's going on.  Don't worry, I got an idea.  Peter, everything's fine. Just look in the mirror.  Well, here you go, about to put you in front of the mirror.  Right now.  Oh, phew, there I am.  Hi, me!  Okay, everything seems normal.  Now to do my traditional \"Mirror Dance.\"  There's a place in France   Where I do my mirror dance   There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all   But the women don't care   'Cause they're dancin' in their underwear.   And their bras.  Okay, that's great, Peter. Time for your nap.  But I'm not tired! I want to go to the Clam and  Thank God.  All right, just switch us all back.  Oh, my God, the machine's been damaged.  It's broken.  Swapping four bodies must've overloaded its system.  If I can't fix it, we'll be like this forever.  This is a total disaster,  like when the fat man tried to keep Michael Shannon  from going insane.  Meadows. Snowflakes.  Breeze through a cornfield.  A soaring bird. Rain on a metal roof.  Hey, Peter, I'm gonna need you to fill out your time card.  Yeah, sure, I'll have it by the end of the day.    It's okay.  We'll hire new people and start again tomorrow.  TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to a human hand  rolling a ball of clay.  - Yay! - Yay!  Stewie, enough of that. We have to fix the machine.  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Oh, God, the fat man's friends.  What's the black one's name?  Cleveland.  Cleveland, right.

Let's go.  That was close.  All right, let's get upstairs and fix  LOIS: Peter, come in the kitchen, I need your help.  What? Huh? I'm watching something.  Oh, God, keep him busy. I'll make this quick.  Hey, I realized I can reach the animal crackers,  so I'm actually gonna be a while.  Here, load these in the car.  Are you going away for a long time?  Oh, darn it. Darn.  Please tell me you didn't forget.  This is the weekend we're going to Dr. Johann's retreat.  Oh, uh, of course. Uh, remind me what that is again.  It's the couples' sex seminar  where the husband learns how to give his wife an orgasm.  Wait, are you saying  we have to have sex this weekend?  Yup. All weekend long.  Now that's what I call a curveball.  (\"CHARGE\" PLAYS ON ORGAN)  Commercial!  Peter? Everything okay?  You hardly spoke the whole car ride.  STEWIE: Uh, I-I was simply thunderstruck  at the prospect of intercoursing you. Darling.  (PHONE BEEPS)  (LINE RINGING)  Brian, you've got to help me.  Lois signed us up for some perverse, pee-pee-related class  on the female orgasm. She's crazed.  BRIAN: Wow.  You've got to get here with the machine so I can fix it.  Right. So I can take your place in Peter's body.  No! Bring everybody.  We've got to get things back to normal.  And hurry, she's all revved up.  (KNOCKING ON GLASS)  (WHIMPERS)  45 minutes to Weekapaug. If we hurry, we can get there  before Stewie's scarred for life.  CHRIS: Brian, it's only 10:30 a.m.  Why does my body crave alcohol?  That's perfectly normal for this time of day.  I'm sweating and shaking and planning out lies.  Yeah, well, why do I have the overwhelming urge  to eat Cheetos and masturbate in the woods?  Well, because it's 10:30 a.m.  I like us learning about each other.  Okay, everyone, please put your bananas and donuts  back on the table, we're done with that exercise.  Next, we'll focus on the female genitalia.  Oh, good Lord!  I mean, va-va-voom! Right, other men?  PETER: I'm confused as hell,  but I'm enjoying these graham crackers,  so I'm not gonna say anything.  What the hell was that?  - I think that was on purpose. - (TIRES SCREECH)  Oh, you think I forgot about you?  You owe my wife 100 bucks for a lavatory misunderstanding.  Hey, sugar.  I've never seen you before in my life.  Yeah, what are you even talking oh, Stewie.  - Aah! - Aah!  Brian, we got to get out of here.  All right, let's have an inconsistently smashed  windshield chase.    (YELLS)  (ELECTRICITY HUMMING)  (WHIRRING)  (BEEPING)  (POLICE SIREN CHIRPS)  Joe, thank God.

Now we need to find  an energy source powerful enough to match the electrical surge  that swapped the town in the first place.  According to my GPS, you're 20 feet  from the base of the Quahog cell phone tower.  BRIAN: Okay, I think I found it.  Now I need you to strap the body swapper on your back  and climb to the top of the tower.  There's no time to waste.  (POUNDING)  (SCREAMING)  (WHIMPERS)  Muncha buncha Fritos!  No!  Brian, hurry!  Stewie, I'm in Chris's body.  I'm dragging 230 pounds of lard up a ladder.  I'm 215, you liberal dickweed!  (GRUNTS)  Okay, I'm at the top.

Who are they? What do the want?  A millennial can be defined  as anyone born between 1982 and 2000.  Or anyone who thinks loving sriracha or Austin, Texas,  counts as a personality.  Millennials crave things like:  instant gratification,  authentic experiences,  and, for some reason we haven't figured out yet,  improv comedy.  Here's one millennial who has a parakeet  with nine million followers on Snapchat.  Here's another who singlehandedly started  the hashtags that cancelled 12 network TV shows  she found offensive.  And now I'm told she identifies as a man,  so I'm being fired.  ANNOUNCER 2 (SIMILAR VOICE): Hello. I'm your new announcer.  And actually, he was just about done.  Thank you and good day.  So please welcome someone who's gonna help us reach millennials,  our new head of social media, Hammer.  (PHONE CHIMES)  Oh. He just group-texted us \"hello.\"  - (CHIME) - And now here comes a text  from the guy who doesn't know this is a group text.  \"Nice to meet you, Hammer. Let's have lunch later,  and I'll tell you who's gay.\"  Right on. 'Sup? I'm Hammer.  Uh, first I'd like to not thank you for hiring me,  because I just expect good things to happen to me  without working for them.  Second, I'd like to give you all a list of my trigger warnings.  What's a trigger warning?  Actually, brah, asking me what a trigger warning is  is one of my triggers, brah.  I feel traumatized, brah.  And now I'm tweeting about you, brah.  And now you're trending, brah.  And now your life is ruined, brah.  And now you're fired, brah.  What what happened to Brah?  Also, the lack of diversity here is horrifying, brah.  Uh, Brah is gone.  Now, if we want to get some social media attention,  we got to start with a group selfie.  Um, excuse me. Didn't Ellen do this, like, three years ago?  Hey, does Taye Diggs follow you on Twitter?  No, but Kraft Singles does.  That's what I thought.  (CLICKS)  And posted.  Do you know what I just did? I just made you all viral.  Also, my band is playing tonight at an inconvenient time.  It's six un-showered guys and a pale woman with a ukulele  shouting \"Hey!\" in unison.  Because that's what music is now.    Hey!   Hey!   What is this? They just keep saying \"hey.\"  I know. It's my favorite song.  Oh, 'cause \"hay\" is for horses.  Hey, guys. You want to have a smoke break?  What? We can't smoke inside.  It's not smoking, Peter. It's vaping.  Everyone's doing it Even Darth Vaper.  (AMPLIFIED INHALE, EXHALE)  (LIKE DARTH VADER): I find your lack of vape disturbing.  Come on, Peter, give it a shot.  What happened? All of a sudden  I feel like I know better than everyone else!  That's because anytime someone walks through a cloud  of vape smoke, a millennial is born.  I think I feel it!  Broad City is so funny.  No, Broad City is genius.  No, no. Broad City is everything!  There it is. Grossly exaggerating  the quality of a just-okay TV show.  Peter, you're officially a millennial.  Hey, you want a ride in the Millennial Falcon?  Ah, look at that We found another one!  Peter, a rite of passage for any millennial  is attending Coachella.  It's a great place to see bands  that are either really new or really old.  - Which one should we see? - Well, on the main stage,  it's Tame Impala that formed in an UberPOOL on the way here.  And on the side stage, it's \"Neil Young asleep\"  in front of the television.\"  (CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)  I always get him confused with Bloom County's Bill the Cat.  Peter, you're doing great as a millennial.  Next thing is you got to learn how to be on Fleek.  \"On fleek\"? People still say \"on fleek\"?  No, Peter, that's not what I meant.  I want you on Fleek.  This is Fleek.  Oh, can I ride him?!  Sure, Peter. Get on Fleek.    Yay!    Our country's involved in six different wars,  but millennials think about this stuff.  Remember, Peter, never walk anywhere  when you can ride something weird instead.  What's that? Sorry, I was taking a selfie  while shooting a Snapchat while Periscoping that Snapchat  while Instagramming latte art while Shazaming The Weekend  while streaming Master of None while retweeting George Takei  while saying, \"This wins the Internet!\"  while still being soooo bored.  Hammer?  Hammer? Come on, man, don't make me look up from my phone.  - (CHIME) - Oh, you're texting me.  Oh, no! Hammer!  You! Call 911!  You! Give me your shirt to make a tourniquet!  You! Snap a pic. Clarendon filter. Clarendon!  Hammer, stay with me, buddy.  Peter, if I die,  chop my body up and serve me as street tacos.  So selfless.  No! I won't let you be made into tacos!  (WHEEZING): Peter it's-it's too late.  Listen, I've got this idea for a business, and  I want you to have it.  It's artisanal.  A-Artisanal  Artisanal what? Is it pretzels?  Is it artisanal pretzels?!  Has that been done?  Does anyone know if artisanal pretzels is a thing?  It seems so obvious, yet I don't think I've ever seen them.  I better do millennial CPR.  One ugh, whatever  Two ugh, whatever  Three ugh, I'm gonna let my parents take care of this.  I've never been to a millennial funeral.  Yeah, it seems in poor taste that they hired Keyboard Cat.  (PLAYING JAUNTY SONG)  Assembled congregants,  no worries to you.  CONGREGATION: And also to you.  Let us tweet.  Peter, why is he naked in there?  It's an environmental statement.  Lois, please stop looking at my dead friend's dong.  Listen, I made breakfast and drove,  so if there's a dead dong, I'm gonna look at it!  We've all lost a great friend-slash-barista-  slash-deejay-  slash-Genius Bar employee-  slash-person with a yellow highlighter  at the Best Buy exit.  And now a reading from the book of JustJared.  \"Death be the ultimate fail.\"  Peter, I hate to do this here,  but you were good friends with Hammer,  and business at the brewery must go on.  That's why, as of today,  I'm making you head of social media.  Hey, whatever you want. I'm a team player.  I was even one of the 300.  Hey, does 299 work?  'Cause I got to go diarrhea off the cliff.  TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to Marvel's The Offenders.  BILL COSBY: Good morning, you see.  I gathered you all together Kevin Spacey,  Roman Polanski  (LIKE FAT ALBERT): hey, hey, hey  Woody Allen, Steven Seagal,  Matt Lauer with the Pudding Pop,  Brett Ratner,  and you, lesser-known offender James Toback.  MAN (LIKE INCREDIBLE HULK): Don't forget me!  (BOOMING STEPS)  Harvey shower!  (STAMMERS): I-I I-Is Matt Damon coming?  No, but he knows about all of us.  He's very aware of what's going on here, you see.  All right, guys, I got to come up with some social media ideas  for the brewery. What do ya got?  Oh, you want viral? You asked the right guy.  You remember Leeroy Jenkins?  - Yeah. - Right.  - What do you mean, \"right\"? - You know, Leeroy Jenkins.  - What about him? - Do that.  Joe, you can't That already happened.  Do it again. This time with beer.  Hang on a sec.  - Thank you. - How about some fruit in the beer?  No, guys, we need social media-specific plans  to reach a younger audience.  JOE: You remember \"Charlie Bit My Finger\"?  Do that.  You know what? I give up. We've given this  what, almost a minute?  Peter, that's the problem with kids today  They have no attention span.  Wait. That's it!  We'll do a show for people with no attention span.  We'll call it The Six Second Talk Show.  Well, I guess that could work. But it's just so sad  that young people can't pay attention  to something longer than six sec  - (GRUNTS) - MAN: Oh, oh, my God.  JOE and PETER and CLEVELAND: Whoa!  What the hell, you guys?

Are-are the test results in?  Yeah, but  (CHUCKLING): let's save it for the meeting.  Where's your nearest bathroom?  Gender-fluid?  Yes, there will be a lot of that.  Hmm, must be one of them high-tech Japanese toilets.  (ZIPS)  I'm gonna pee into electrical urinal   And make the sparks go higher.   I'm having so much fun.  (WHIRRING)  What the hell is going on?  Our mainframe is having a meltdown!  Hang on, let me flush.  (ALARM RINGING)  You idiot.  You shut down the entire Internet.  How could you do that?  This is the most irresponsible thing that I've ever  PARKER: Although I was incensed by this man,  I had to admire his courage for leaving his penis out  the entire time I was yelling at him.  As a man who struggles with body dysmorphia,  I couldn't help but be impressed  by that kind of self-confidence.  PETER: As I stood there, being berated by this man,  I couldn't help but notice his searching gaze.  Years later, we would bump into each other  at a small cafe in Rome and reminisce about this moment.  And later still, recreate it in a small bed and breakfast  at the bottom of the Spanish Steps.  But that's a story for another time.  Or, as they say in Italian, molto homo.  (GRUNTS)  Peter, you've done some stupid things,  but crashing the Internet has to be the dumbest yet.  Look at the chaos you've caused.  - (SIRENS WAILING) - (PEOPLE SCREAMING)  I have no idea how to drive without texting.  Why can't I post this video?  - Hello. - What did you say?  Why aren't you looking at your phone, you psycho?  Why is no one liking my posts?  Well, I hate all your posts!  Hello.  (SCREAMS)  Hello.  Peter, Lois is right.  This mess is all your fault.  Settle down, Brian.  I'm sure life will be just fine without the Internet.  Maybe we can even go see that Amish comedian.  Sir, where are you from?  MAN: Chicago.  I have never been to Chicago.  How about you, sir?  MAN 2: Boston!  I have never been to Boston.  Anyone here from the back fields of Pennsylvania, Ohio  or upstate New York?  MAN 3: No!  Then I have been Jebediah, son of Abner.  (MICROPHONE DISTORTION)  How are we gonna get back to the airport?  There's no Internet, which means there's no GPS,  which means we can't use Uber.  Okay, I have a crazy idea.  Let's get a cab.  There's a taxi stand.  Dead.  Dead  Dead.  Barely alive.  To the airport.  Now, because you can't stare at your phone anymore,  enjoy a disturbingly loud clip of Jimmy Fallon on cab TV.  Tonight, get ready to lose all respect for Al Pacino  when I force him to play a game meant for children!  This.  This is why Uber.  No Netflix, no Hulu, no Amazon  I'm so bored.  Come on, Meg, you're overreacting.  We still got network TV.  ANNOUNCER: We now return to Kevin Can Wait on CBS.  Well, that's not gonna work.  Okay, everybody, don't panic.  We'll just do what people did before the Internet.  We can play charades.  Oh, you mean like your marriage?  Chris, I told you that in confidence.  Dad, you got to do something.  Nobody can live without the Internet.  Ah, you're right. This sucks.  It's even worse than when I was roommates  with Oscar Pistorius.  - (KNOCK AT DOOR) - Somebody's in here.  - (GUNSHOTS) - Somebody's in here!  I'm the one who screwed this up.  I'll be the one to fix it.  I'll be the Internet.  What are you talking about?  We can do all the things we loved about the Internet.  We just got to do it without technology.  From now on, if you want to tweet something,  you do it the old-fashioned way:  write it on a piece of paper,  staple it to a bird, and throw it out the door.  (CHIRPS)  Hey, do you follow Peter Griffin on Twitter?  No. Why? Is he funny?  No, he just throws dead birds on his lawn.  It's awesome.  Great news, Chris. I figured out  how to recreate the best part of the Internet.  I've got pictures of five celebrities  who you'd never believe used to be fat.  - Great, let's see 'em. - Sure, buddy.  But first you have to watch this unwelcome pop-up ad.  I don't want probiotics.  Then press the \"skip ad\" button.  Why should I do all this work?  They're really good pictures, Chris.  Number three will shock you.  Okay, I'll press it.  Oh, no! You pressed in the wrong place,  and now you're being sent to the ad's website,  which also has additional pop-ups.  This is a nightmare!  Just tell me one of 'em.  Kenan Thompson.  That's not a surprise!  Peter? What are you doing?  Oh, I'm your Waze app today.  - You on your way to work? - Yeah, I am.  All right, you will be there in six minutes.  Just start heading straight.  Okay, sounds good.  - So, how's everything at - Take a right!

Sounds kind of pointless.  Oh, you mean like your feet?  (REPEATED SHOUTING AND LAUGHING)  All right, trying to be the Internet is impossible.  I wish I never peed on that server.  You know, when my phone gets wet,  I just put it in a bag of rice.  Shut up, Meg. That's dumb.  I've done that before. It works.  (GASP) Chris, that's brilliant.  We just need a big bag and a lot of rice.  You sure that's gonna work?  Eh, worth a shot.  We'll just have to roll up our sleeves  and do the best we can,  like the men who built New York City.  Men, creating an entire subway system out of nothing  is grueling, thankless, life-threatening work.  But just remember: we're doing this  so that one day, future commuters can be hassled  by panhandlers and amateur break-dancers.  What about public masturbators?  Especially public masturbators.  Now, let's go die underground!  (WORKERS CHEERING)  Look, we're getting a signal.  I think we fixed the Internet.  Something's coming through.  It looks like an ad.  \"Smithwick's Artisinal Pretzels.\"  Son of a bitch!  Well, I'm glad you got the Internet  H-Hold on.  I'm sorry, what-what were you saying?  Yeah, sounds good.  And send.  Take that, Delta Air Lines.  Submitted for your approval:  a restaurant full of people so distracted by their phones,  they're unaware that they're all about to go up in smoke,  just like the Fox Tuesday night lineup.  (REPEATED SHOUTING AND LAUGHING)         Is it me, or does David Ortiz  look just like the mom on Good Times?  - Oh, Peter, that's racist. - Well, no. Look.  I take it back.  That's not racist. That's just accurate.  Hey, guys, guess who's got the keys  to a speedboat just sitting down at the station?  How'd you get a speedboat?  Well, it's a funny story.  [LAUGHTER.]  That was a funny story.  Especially the funny part.  You really delivered on your promise.  All right, who's up for waterskiing?!  - Hell yeah! - All right!  Yeah, let's do it!  Oh, that sounds amazing! I love boats.  Boats are my thing.  Anything to get out on the open water, enjoy the salt air.  Oh, they're already gone.  PETER: No, you didn't widen enough.  But you still can't come.  Good evening, Quahog. Just parking. Be there in a sec.  [FOOTSTEPS RUNNING.]  Our top story:  authorities have uncovered a mob-run prescription drug ring  targeting Goldman's Pharmacy.  The scam involved fraudulent prescriptions  submitted for dead people.  Pharmacist Mort Goldman failed to report  to authorities for questioning.  A $10,000 bounty has been offered for his return.  $10,000? That's a lot of money.  Could be our money, Brian.  We could find Mort. Easily.  Besides, we haven't done anything together  since our confusing two-host talk show.  So, Chris Pratt, I hear you have a new movie out.  So, Chris, you're from Seattle?  Chris, what was it like working with Amy Poehler?  Hey, Chris, anything you can tell us about Guardians 3?  - Chris!

Well, Mr. Quagmire,  you've had quite the nasty shark attack.  Luckily, you'll be okay.  But you're going to have to learn to live without a penis.  Or will you?  Oh, what's this?  Is it your penis?  Nah, I'm just foolin'.  I play that with my penis-less patients to lighten the mood.  Liev Schreiber gets a big kick out of it.  Doc, do you know who you're talking to?  - That penis was my whole life! - It's not so bad.  At least you're not this pathetic guy  who couldn't get his boat in the water.  [LAUGHS.] Have you seen this?  You should take his wiener. He's clearly not using it.  - [ENGINE REVVING.] - PETER: Stop looking at us!  [LAUGHTER.]  Ah, that that does that does make me feel better.    - What are we doing here? - This is Pitbull's house.  He knows everything about South Florida.  He can help us find Mort.  DOORBELL [PITBULL'S VOICE.]: Doorbell, doorbell,  doorbell, ring.  [LAUGHS.] It's my house.  Esta mi casa.  Wow.

Wouldn't miss it.  Gosh, thanks, Peter. That means a lot.  Okay, see you there.  Damn it! Why did I even open the door?!  Ugh!  Getting excited.  Now I got to go to this thing! Ugh!

Because I can't do this anymore.  My life is over.  I tried to adjust, but it's impossible.  Come on, Quagmire, it's not impossible.  You want impossible, try eating local pizza  with a guy from New York.  You call this pizza?  We do here, yes.  All right, Brian, I negotiated to get Mort  - back from the mob. - How?  I told them Mort gave us his flash drive  with enough evidence to put them all in jail.  We're going to trade it for Mort and collect our money.  And I also ordered an extra slice of pie.  Because you know how many times we live, Brian?  Once.  [SNICKERS.] Once.  [BOTH LAUGH.]  [DOORBELL RINGS.]  - Hey, Dad. - I'm so sorry, Glenn.  Stop staring, Cleveland!  CLEVELAND: I can support his lifestyle  and still think it's weird!  - Thank you, Cleveland. - Have a blessed day!  Believe me, Glenn, I know what you're going through.  No, you don't.  You had yours surgically removed in a hospital.  I had mine bitten off by a shark!  I'm not allowed to go into the ocean anymore.  The doctor says I can't get seawater in it.  I also have Crohn's disease.  They're unrelated.  Why are you here, Dad?  I knew you were down in the dumps,  so I brought you something to cheer you up.  A Yeti cooler?  - That is kind of rad. - No, that's mine.  Your gift is inside.    Is that your?  Yes, Glenn. It's my penis.  After my surgery, I kept it in my freezer.  Next to a snowball from the winter, if you can believe that.  I want you to have it.  I I can't take your penis, Dad.  Please, take it.  If you don't, I'm just gonna give it to Paul Ryan.  I don't know what to say.  Thank you.  [SINGSONGY.]: Weird.  Proud of you guys, but weird.  [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY.]  Okay, has everyone washed their hands?  Me neither, but going forward, let's try.  I'm so nervous for Quagmire.  I know, but it's nice that they served hot dogs for the surgery.  There it is! Give me that!  - [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY.] -    Nurse, you put it on there. I'm not gay.  The operation was a success.  - Congratulations, Quagmire! - Thanks, guys.  And, Dad, I don't know how to thank you.  You've given me the greatest gift I could ever ask for.  - I love you, son. - I love you, too.  - So, will it work, Dr. Hartman? - Oh, yes.  I'm not sure about urination or sex, but otherwise, yes.  So, how you feeling?  I'm actually in extreme pain, Doc.  It's like knives are stabbing into my crotch.  Don't worry, that'll go away  once you fill your prescription at Goldman's Pharmacy.  - Mort's is closed. - Oh. Oh, yeah.  Cool tie-in with the other story, though.  I'm trying to get more involved in the writing this season.  In fact, I think Family Guy should be more of a dramedy.  - What's a dramedy? - Well, for one thing,  the scenes don't have to end with jokes.  [CRICKETS CHIRPING.]  - You got the flash drive? - Yep.  All the information that could put you away forever.  Now, again, I don't know why we couldn't  have done this by Dropbox.  I mean, I don't mind coming here to a parking lot  I had to get Mort anyway but  Dropbox would've saved you time.  And you wouldn't have to mail me back my flash drive.  What do you mean, mail it back?  You were planning to keep it? It's 64 gigs!  I bought the coverage. You're not getting the coverage.  Hi, guys. I'm a pharmacist.  Ugh, Mort is so hard to write for.  Okay, give us Mort.  My mailing address is in the flash drive.  - [SIREN WAILING.] - FBI!

Good, pretty good.  I've been having a lot of sex. Um  My dad didn't mention there's a four-inch mole on the left side.  - What? - Uh-huh.  It's, like, the size of a 50-cent piece  - and a dime kissing each other. - Yikes. Frightening.  Yeah, some gals find it off-putting.  I try to tell them it's my dad's old penis, but that, um  that just tends to make it worse.  But the girls that stay are just great.  Well, I'm happy for you, Quagmire.  Don't be. Anyway, I got to take a leak.  Well, I'm just glad our friend's  - back to his old self. - [QUAGMIRE SCREAMING.]  Yeah, seems he hasn't missed a beat.  It's great that we can be there for each other in trying times.  - What's that noise? - [QUAGMIRE CONTINUES SCREAMING.]  That's the sound of peeing out your daddy's wiener.   - Peter, you're not even dressed. - For what?  Chris's class is performing a rock and roll choir.  They've been practicing for months.  \"For months,\" or \"four months\"?  For months. Three months.  Not long enough.

Ready?  Actually, I've decided to keep the couch on me.  Really? Are you sure?  Oh, yeah. This is nothing.  I've been in uncomfortable situations before.  Like, whenever I meet famous people.  Hey, what's up? I'm Snoop Dogg, know what I'm saying?  I do.  PETER: But you don't, Peter, you don't.  How is it? Is-a good?  Eh, it's a little tight.  A little tight in-a the couch?  Yeah, it's a little tight in the couch.  Hey, what's it like going through life  holding needles in your lips?  Is-a not easy.  Some-a time-a the needle, they poke-a my lip,  and I say-a, \"Mamma mia!\"  Well, you still got James Brolin coming in here,  autographing your photos.  That's kind of cool.  You want to know something, a-Peter?  He no come in here.  I take-a the photo from the dry cleaner's.  Mamma mia, what a day.  And now to say good night  to all-a my celebrity pictures on-a the wall.  Buona notte, Christopher Plummer.  Sleep-a with the angels, Sherman-a Hemsley.  See you when-a the sun shine, Ken Ober.  And now, to say good night to my favorite-a celebrity,  James-a Brol mamma mia!  Who steal-a my James Brolin?  I take-a that photo from the bakery.  Pasta fazool, what a good day in-a the bakery.  You take-a good care of the place  while I'm-a gone, William-a Katt.  That goes a-double for you, James-a Brol mamma mia!  Uh, hey, Mom?  Was I always able to see the living room from the kitchen?  (SIGHS) I've had enough of this.  That stupid couch is messing up our house.  If Peter won't let Dr. Hartman remove it,  we're doing it ourselves.  I put an Ambien in his beer, so he's out cold.  I saw you put Ambien in your beer, too.  Every adult has to take Ambien every night  to even have a prayer at sleep.  (SNORING)  (DOOR CREAKS)  All right, kids, we're gonna use these scissors  to separate your father from the couch.  I can't tell skin from couch.  Well, err on the skin side.  I love this couch.  It's from Ethan Allen, you know.  (SCISSORS SNIPPING)  Wha?  W-What-what's going on?  Peter, enough is enough, that couch is coming off.  We're sick of your shenanigans.  (GRUNTS) How dare you?  I work my ass off to bring home the bacon for this family,  and all you can say is, \"We don't want bacon,  we want actual money!\"  Well, I don't have money, I spent it all on bacon!  Peter, put yourself in our shoes.  I can't. My feet swelled up too much from all the bacon.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to sleep  on the couch on the couch.  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTING)  (GRUNTING)  Chris, give me a hand with this.  All right, you ready?  All right, one, two, three.  - Okay, uh, easy, easy, easy - Uh uh  - Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. - Okay, all right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  - Stop, stop. - What? What?  - No, no, no, no, no. Twist it. - What? I am.  Just look down, all right? Just-just look at me,  look what I'm doing. All right, see the way I'm twisting it?  - Okay, ju No, no, no, no, no. - Okay. Wait what?  You know what? All right, just Hang just put-put it down.  - Put it down. Just drop it, drop it. - All right. All right.  All right, let's Let's just hang on and figure this out.  All-all right, okay.  All right. Okay. I-I got it. I know what we're gonna  Okay, okay. All right, y-you We here's what we're gonna do,  We're gonna take the cushions off,  unscrew the legs, take the mattress out,  and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler.  It's easier than we're making it.  - (GRUNTING) - This isn't working.  You know what? Just give me a push.  (GRUNTS)  (SCREAMING)  (CRASHES)  I have some bad news.  Ethan survived, but Allen didn't make it.  - What about Peter? - Oh, him.  He's in what we call a comma.  Now, where's his chart?  Ah, here it is. \"Griffin coma Peter.\"  Will he ever recover?  How long is he gonna be like this?  (ECHOING): Please tell me he's gonna be okay  (WIND GUSTING)  Oh, God.  (MALE CLEARS THROAT)  God?  Yes.  And no Trump questions.  Okay.  I have nothing else to ask you.  I can't believe I'm stuck in an elevator with God.  Although, I guess you are everywhere, and in all places.  No, you're thinking of Kevin Hart.  Ha! I know, right?  (LAUGHING): I-In every movie.  Him and The Rock.  Oh, I love The Rock.  No, no, no, I love The Rock, too.  He's just-he's just in a lot of stuff.  You know, his real name is Dwayne Johnson.  Yeah, I know.  We have Us Weekly on Earth, too.  Wait, why are you here?  Shouldn't you be up in heaven?  There was an issue.  Uh, a-a few angels came forward.  I don't remember things exactly as they do,  but I respect their experience.  How did I get here?  Well, you had a couch attached to your back,  and you fell down the stairs and hit your head pretty hard.  Am I in a Leftovers?  Is this a Leftovers?  I don't know what that is.  It was an HBO show starring a bottle of hair dye.  Man, this thing is really stuck.  Hey, can you use your God powers to get us out?  No, they don't really work in elevators.  Kind of like a cell phone.  I don't have a signal.  I have a cell phone.  It's silver.  That's rad, Peter.  I always dreamed of being stuck in an elevator with Tom Brady.  That makes two of us.  Can I ask you my Tom Brady questions?  I wouldn't deign to speak for Tom Brady.  Understood, understood.  - Hey, do atheists go to hell? - No.  How about people who say they are not religious,  but they are spiritual?  Straight to hell, to the boiler room of hell.  All the way down.  Sometimes, I pull them out  just so they think everything is gonna be okay,  but then, I put them right back in.  Good, good.  That makes me happy.  Um, God, here's something you might be able to tell me.  Will Taylor Swift and Katy Perry  ever reconcile their differences?  What are you looking for?  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm looking for the gay guy  who can answer that one.  Some people say we're just a computer simulation  run by a higher species.  - Is that true? - It is.  (COMPUTER TONES PLAY)  My guy sucks.  Want to trade guys for a little while?  Oh, never mind.  I'll stick with this pile of crap I already have.  All right, can you name every SNL actor alphabetically?  - Alphabetically by last name? - Yes.  - And no featured players? - Yeah, okay.  Fred Armisen, Dan Aykroyd, Morwenna Banks, Vanessa Bayer  Jon Lovitz, Norm Macdonald, Gail Matthius  Gail Matthius, good pull.  Michael McKean, Mark McKinney  Nancy Walls, Kristen Wiig, and Sasheer Zamata.  Wow. Now do Kids in the Hall.  That was five guys, Peter.  - Name 'em. - I can't.  Does reincarnation exist?  It does.  As past human lives or as animals?  - Both. - Who have I been?  - You were Henry the Eighth. - Wow!  Let me finish. You were Henry, the eighth guy to have sex  with Rock Hudson at one of his pool parties.  Aww.  How many more shows is John Stamos gonna get?  - Zero. - Good. That's That's good.  Are you real?  Do you think I'm real, Peter?  I like to believe there's something bigger than me  out there keeping a watch out.  Different people think different things.  I'm kind of like a nanny cam.  The idea that I may exist is enough  for some people to behave better.  When I used to ask my mom what God was, she would say,  \"God is love.\" I always liked that.  That's nice, Peter.  God and love are very similar concepts.  - They come from the same place. - Tatooine?  Ha! I always forget you're such a Star Wars guy.  Man, when are they gonna fix this elevator?  It's not broken. I just haven't decided where it's going yet.  (GASPS) What's a \"mezzanine\"?  - It's like a loge. - What's a \"loge\"?  Oh, hey, what's with all the questions?  Yeah, you don't know either.  W-Wait, hold on.  - Am I Am I dead? - Yes.  Oh, my God!  Since you're now a ghost, would you like to do pottery  while straddling present-day Demi Moore?  - Pass. - Yeah.  Not getting a lot of takers for that one.  I feel like the bones in her back  would hurt my tummy.  Am I Am I really dead?  Well, if you weren't dead,  would you feel nothing when I do this?  Ah! Son of a bitch!  Oh, you know what? That's right, it takes a day.  M-My bad. Sorry.  Tomorrow I do that, you feel nothing.  But trust me, you're dead.  But I can't be. Hold on, give me a sec.  (PANTING)  I can't be dead. I have a family who needs me.  Actually, Peter, from what I've seen,  I think your family would be better off without you.  What? What do you mean?  Well, you're an inattentive husband  and a terrible parent.  Oh, says Father of the Year.  Oh, please. He played that for all it was worth.  \"Why has thou forsaken me?\"  You know what? I did him a favor.  Okay, well, th-there's a lot to unpack there.  But come on, God, you gotta give me another chance.  I'll show you how good a husband and father I can be.  Are you asking for a second chance?  I-I guess so.  Huh. No one's ever done that.  You know what? You're on.  I'll give you one day to prove to me  that your family is better off with you alive.  I'll return you to your life before you were in a coma.  Thanks, God! I know I can do it.  I've faced bigger challenges.  Like when I recorded that Russian language album.  (\"TEQUILA SONG\" BY THE CHAMPS PLAYING)    Vodka!   Okay, kids. I know how you always wanted kittens,  so guess what I brought home?  This very pregnant, about-to-burst,  distended-nipples street cat.  (LABORED MEOW)  Peter, you can't bring home a feral cat.  She doesn't want to be around people right now.  She needs a quiet space to have her kittens.  Yeah, so everyone gather 'round close.  Her name is Sophie, and she's fully dilated.  - (YOWLING) - Chris!  She doesn't like that, but I understand the instinct.  Now, we all need to do our part to help with the birth.  - Meg, boil some water. - (CAT SCREECHING)  Brian, get some clean rags.  Chris, blankets.  - Stewie, Band-Aids for me. - (CAT GROWLING)  Isn't it nice that we're spending this time together  as a family?  Let's go spend it in the ER.  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Well, look at us. Out for a fun family dinner.  If anyone's watching, they'd say, \"Look at that family.\"  Look how happy they are.\"  Well, the kids do love Fuddruckers.  Yeah, getting to design any burger you want?  Your only limit is your imagination.  What kind you make there for yourself, Chris?  - Plain. - Plain?  What do you mean \"plain\"?  It's a plain burger. That's how I like them.  That's not a burger, that's just a meat sandwich.  At least Meg went wild and got a beige burger.  No, I got chicken.  What? Here? This is Fuddruckers.  What what part of Fuddruckers don't you understand?  All of it.  All right, let's start this again.  You're all gonna get up,  go back up to that toppings bar, and go nuts.  But it tastes good like this.  It's not supposed to taste good. It's supposed to look crazy.  What the hell are you doing?  I'm cutting it. It's easier to eat.  It's not supposed to be easy to eat.  Half of it is supposed to fall onto your plate  when you squeeze it, and the rest goes onto your shirt.  How's everything going over here?  Terrible! Go away!  See, look, now I have to be even more ridiculous  to make up for what you guys aren't doing.  Silverware? Put them on. Salt shaker? Whatever.  Ice from soda, get on that burger.  Peter, people are staring.  Yeah, they're saying, \"Look at the creative guy.  \"Look at King Fuddrucker over there.  \"Usually you put a burger on a tray.  This guy's putting a tray on a (BLEEP) burger!\"  Are you through, Peter?  Not yet, I'm not. Give me the car keys.  - Peter - Give me the car keys.  That's Fuddruckers.  (CAR ALARM CHIRPS)  Peter, you've opened the trunk.  People are pulling things out of our car.  Good. That's also Fuddruckers Get used to it.  And prepare to fish my teeth out of my stool.  - Peter, enough. - You guys clearly don't get it.  I'm sure when you explain what we're supposed to get,  we'll get it.  (BOTH SIGH)  Those poor kids. Those poor babies.  Hey, Chris, what do you got there?  A plain burger.  Looks good.  PETER: You can do this, Peter.  You love your family.  You can do this, Peter, you love your family.  You can do this, Peter. You love your family.  Dad, can you crack your window a little bit?  I hate you all so much!  - (THUNDER RUMBLES) - Uh-oh.  (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)    (BRAKES SQUEAK)  Ah!  (TIRES SCREECHING)  (THUNDER CRASHES)  (SCREAMS)  Did you guys see that?  The bunny rabbit family you just ran over?  Yeah. We all saw that, Peter.  Come on, kids. Let's go inside.  Before you go, there's something I want to say.  If anything were to happen to me, Lois,  I'll miss you more than life  the cereal, but not the board game, which I quite enjoy.  - Okay. - And Meg,  I'm sorry I'll never get a chance  to walk you down the aisle at Costco,  to furnish your sad, single-lady apartment.  - Thanks, Dad. - And Stewie,  it kills me that I'll never see you become a man loving twink.  Is anyone gonna stop him?  And, Chris, whenever you're feeling defeated,  I want you to remember to always reach for the Stars  Sky and Hutch DVD that fell behind the entertainment center.  Sorry, you were the last one.  - What about me? - You're a dog.  Peter, what's going on? Why are you saying these things?  Sorry. W-Why don't you guys go inside?  I'm gonna stay out here and listen to Nina Blackwood  slowly die of throat cancer on the radio.  WOMAN (SCRATCHY VOICE): Our next artist first climbed the charts  with \"Dancing With Myself.\"  (WHEEZES) Of course, that artist is Billy Idol.  -(RADIO SWITCHES OFF) - I'm supposed to get her  a week from Thursday, but I may be moving that up.  I suppose you know why I'm here.  Yeah. I guess so.  It's weird. For the first seven days,  all I did was create things, but since then,  it's just killing, killing, killing.  Well, go ahead and do it.  My family would be better off without me.  I'm a terrible husband and a terrible father.  I should never have questioned you.  You were right about everything.  Say that again.  You were right about everything.  That's all I needed to hear.  That's what religion is.  It's not about being good or bad.  It's just blind subservience to an imaginary being.  So, I'm not gonna die?  Nope, not for another four years.  Thank you, God!  Bless you, my child pornography fan.  (LAUGHS) You did it to me.  - Can I use that one on my son? - Sure.  PETER: Hey, Chris, you like pictures of naked children  because you're gross and weird.  Ah, he screwed it up.  And I'm sorry about Fuddruckers.  It won't happen again.  Because nothing means more to me than my family.  Oh, Peter. That's wonderful. What helped you come around?  Well, Lois, let's just say the big man upstairs  put in a hard day's work today.  Well, looks like quitting time.  Good night, Kirk Cameron.  See you tomorrow, Gene Rayburn.  See you when the sun rises, James Bro Mamma mia!         Hey, you guys ever check Zillow?  Joe, why don't you shut the  Tell me more about this silly word.  It's this website, Zillow.com.  You plug in your address, and it gives you an estimate  of what your house is worth.  But they call it a Zestimate,  because of the \"Z\" in \"Zillow.\"  (LAUGHS)  How do they  I just don't have that creative bone.  Wow, my house is way up from when I bought it.  - Mine's up, too. - What the hell?  Mine's way below what you guys's are worth.  Wait, this-this can't be right.  It says it says my house is a murder house.  What, like-like someone was killed there?  Yeah, it says it says, in the '60s,  some woman named Doris Billingsly died in my house.  Probably some naggy bitch, right?  - Joseph! - You know, they say  when someone dies violently like that,  - their spirit can linger. - What do you mean?  Ea I'm saying you might have a g-g-g-g-g  disembodied spirit in your house!  Wow, this is so cool.  Have you ever witnessed anything strange there?  Actually, now that you mention it  Good news! The biopsy was negative.  Did you hear something?    Hi, Chris.  Oh, hey, Kristen. What's up?  Not much. I wanted to know  if you're gonna go to the dance on Friday.  Nah, probably not.  Oh, that's too bad.  I was thinking maybe you and I could go together.  Oh, that's sweet, but, like I said,  I-I don't think I'm gonna go.  Well, if you change your mind  I said no!  Okay. Geez.  Bye, Chris.  Uh, Chris, that very attractive girl  just asked you out, and you said no.  Well, sorry, Brian, she just doesn't do it for me.  I'm hungry.  I might grab a bite to eat.  We all just ate, right?  What's wrong with that kid?  Why wouldn't he go out with that girl?  Who knows? Maybe he's gay.  What? No.  Well, you never know. I say we find out.  You think he could be?  Hey, I've been right about these things before.  Remember what I said in 2009?  - Bruce Jenner is a man. - No, Brian.  That's what the press would have you believe, but he's not.  Bruce Jenner is a woman.  An elegant, beautiful Dutch woman.  (THUNDER CRASHING)  Okay, guys, now, the murder took place down here in the basement,  so it's probably our best shot at finding something.  I do feel a presence in the air.  CLEVELAND: Only Lucifer would reveal himself to you, adulterer.  Well, now, I have to warn you fellas  The only spirits I'm used to chasing are whiskey and tequila.  (LAUGHING)  That's so Joe!  (BOWLING PINS CLACKING)  Wow, what's going on down here?  Trying something new for Joe.  And we're looking for ghosts.  We're like the male version of the female Ghostbusters.  Peter, there's no such thing as ghosts.  I don't know why you guys listen to a word he says.  (CHUCKLES): That's so Lois.  (CASH REGISTER DINGS)  All right, we ready?  QUAGMIRE: Wow, it is creepy.  So, what do we do?  PETER: Just follow my lead.  Are there any spirits present  that would like to communicate with us?  (THUNDER RUMBLES)  - (PETER SCREAMS) - (THUMPING)  QUAGMIRE: What the hell was that?  I got scared and tried to run through the wall,  leaving a hole shaped like me.  Yeah, can't do that in a basement, bud.  All right, fellas, I just finished up an EVP session.  Let's see if we picked anything up.  What's EVP?  Electronic voice phenomenon.  Oftentimes, the human ear can't pick up paranormal sounds,  but electronic recording devices can.  Mm. That right?  (PETER ON RECORDING)  (PASSES GAS)  (GASPS)  (PASSING GAS)  Is this whole thing just you beefing into the microphone?  Yeah.  Dad, they did this bit in the lady Ghostbusters.  Did you hear something?  Stewie, I'm telling you, there's no way Chris is gay.  Oh, why, because he never hit on you?  God, the ego.  Hey, Chris. What's up?  Just relaxing, listening to some of Charles Manson's music.  What's up with you guys?  Actually, Brian and I are taking a survey,  and we wanted to see if you had a few minutes.  - Sure. Go ahead. - Okay, question one.  What night are the Tony Awards?  Tony Danza has awards?  Name an appropriate price to pay for jeans.  Um, five dollars?  What year did Bette Midler release  \"You've Got to Have Friends\"?  Oh, 1972.  And it was fabulous!  Chris, are you gay?  What? No, I'm not gay.  Well, then why didn't you go out with that girl?  (CHUCKLES) Why would I?  I have everything I need in that department on my computer.  You have 28 windows of porn playing simultaneously?  Sometimes I pretend I'm at the security desk at the mall  and everyone at the mall is banging each other.  Chris, don't you see?  You're so desensitized by all this porn,  you're-you're not even interested in actual girls.  Wh-What are you doing?  I'm taking this, and we are gonna help you start thinking  about sex like a normal teenager.  A-All right, I'll give it a shot.  But it's not gonna be easy.  I had a hell of a time getting off sugar.  Chris, can you pass the syrup?  Oh, you want the syrup, old man?!  (GRUNTING)  (SHOUTS)  Yeah!  (CACKLING)  (LAUGHS)  Yeah, nice attached head, Meg.  Body, throw potatoes.  (GRUNTS)  Winner declared!  Okay, guys, now, I thought we could try to find the ghost  by doing the movie Flatliners.  - I've never seen it. - Me, neither.  Oh, my God. All right, we are stopping everything right now  and watching Flatliners.  KENNY LOGGINS:  I'm all right   I'm glad we switched to Caddyshack.  You know what, Peter, I think I've had enough ghost hunting.  - I'm done, too. - Yeah, I'm out.  Wait, why you leaving?  Because all you do is screw around.  We've been down here for hours, and we haven't found a thing.  Well, maybe that's because you guys don't know the first thing  about catching ghosts.  You know what, Lois was right.  We should just never listen to you.  Come on, guys.  I think you're all just scared.  Oh, yeah? Let's see who's scared.  What are you doing? Turn that light back on.  QUAGMIRE: Have a good night, Peter.  - (POUNDING) - PETER: Quagmire. Help!  Someone help me!  Hey!

Peter, your hair.  It turned white.  What?    (GASPS)  Well, I'm a fat dad with white hair now.  Time to become an issue at Hooters after 9:00 p.m.  Hey, Ashley. Ashley.  Ashley.  I know I know what car is your car.  So, how'd you get white hair again?  He was scared of a ghost.  Yes, I remember hearing about this in med school.  Or was it a Scooby-Doo?  You think it's gonna stay, Dr. Hartman?  No, it's gonna be \"Dr. Ramirez\" now.  I'm taking my husband's name.  I'm talking about Peter's hair.  Oh, I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES) Wedding on the brain.  But, uh, as for the white hair, I'm afraid it's permanent.  (PHONE RINGS)  Hi, sweetie.  We've discussed this.  No to the mole.  Chocolate is for cake, not chicken.  Oh, come on.  He's crying.  What do I do now? I mean, should I dye it back?  (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)  I don't know why you'd ask me that.  I mean, I-I don't know anything about that.  How does one even go about dyeing one's hair?  I've never heard of anything so crazy.  Let me get that for you, Doctor.  What? Oh, no, I'm-I'm not a  Morning, Doctor.  Wow, Peter, they all think you're a doctor  because of your white hair.  I have to say, it does make you look more distinguished.  Really? Huh.  Well, maybe this will be a good thing after all.  Like a garbageman with no nose.  Well, this is the best job in the world!  Rotting meat?  What does that smell like?  Oh, look, receipts.  I'll steal this person's identity.  From now on, I'm Robert Dibadeaux.  So long, stinkies!  Not that I would know.  All right, Chris, it's gonna take a few steps  to get you off hard-core porn.  Now, the first step is soft-core porn,  where nothing really happens.  (TV CLICKS ON)  Oh, wow, she is just riding that guy's belly button.  Yep, that's all we had.  And you could watch this at any time?  No, just Friday at 11:45 p.m.  And it was free?  No, $45 a month.  Well, what was playing the other 200 hours per week?  Uh, mostly D.A.R.Y.L. The movie D.A.R.Y.L.  Was it any good?  It was okay.  Grandpa, what are you doing here?  Using the bathroom. Where do you keep the nets  that you put on the bottom of guys' balls  to stop 'em from dunking in the water?  - What? - What do you mean, \"What?\"  (RHYTHMICALLY): Where do you keep the nets  that you put on the bottom of guys' balls  to stop them from dunking in the water?  Oh, there's my silver fox.  What are you doing out here?  Well, now that I've got white hair,  I fix my car in slow motion  in an ad for a supplemental blood thinner.  - (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) - I took Zanbrex  for over 15 years,  till I learned the benefits of once-daily Sanguelto,  a latest-generation blood thinner.  When I'm at a multiracial picnic for some reason,  the last thing I want to do is have a stroke.  And thanks to once-daily Sanguelto,  I can eat potato salad with chuckling strangers  with the confidence of someone who knows  he's 12% less likely to suffer a stroke recurrence.  Thanks to Sanguelto, I can snuggle  with my age-appropriate wife on a blanket  underneath non-holiday-related fireworks.  I left her for six weeks back in 2009,  only to realize I was already too old  to bed the type of women  that would make such a separation worth it.  So, here we are, grinding it out  till onef us has that second stroke  that you don't come back from.  Thank you, Sanguelto.  What's all this?  Well, a lot of kids' first foray into sex  is looking at someone else's porn stash.  So, here's a stack of water-stained Playboys  that I found in a locker at the town pool bathroom.  Okay, now we're talking.  (WHOOSHING)  Wait. I'm clicking on this thumbnail,  but the video isn't opening.  No, that's a still image.  See, you look at them,  and then your brain sort of creates a scene for you.  I don't know. I think maybe we should try something else.  I think you should give it a shot.  I think we should all go investigate  the still-unsolved murder of Doris Billingsly,  who never did anything but overcook one dinner  in March of 1962.  All right, I got next round.  - Hey, Tom, you okay? - She left me.  Another sign from the universe that I'll never find love.  Hey, come on, pal. There's plenty of fish in the sea.  Wow.  You're right. There are.  Say, you've got a way about you,  a certain trustworthy quality.  You know, we've got an opening  at the station for a senior analyst.  I think your white hair would be perfect for it.  Wow. Really? What do I do?  You just act like everyone else is an idiot and shout over them.  - That way, you can - Shut up! I get it!  Terrific. Hey, why don't you come down  to the station tomorrow and?  - I know where you work! - Again, terrific.  Wow, this is awesome.  I haven't been on TV since I had IBS on The Bachelorette.  Derek, I had such a magical weekend.  You are truly one of a kind.  (LOUD STOMACH GRUMBLING)  And that's why I've decided to  Excuse me. Uh, do-do you know if I'm gonna get a rose?  We're getting to that, Peter.  Derek, that's why I've decided to give you this rose.  (STOMACH GRUMBLING AND SQUEALING)  Evan, getting to see your softer side was truly  - (STOMACH GROWLING) - Excuse me.  I hate to be a bother, but do you  do you know if I'll be receiving a rose?  Because if there's, uh, further delay,  I believe something's gonna happen  that will put me out of contention for a rose.  (STOMACH GURGLES LOUDLY)  And that thing just happened.  Farewell, and thank you  for feeding me champagne and shrimp all day.  Reporting live from Quahog Prison,  I'm Joe Horrigan, Channel Five News.  Thanks, Joe. Great reporting, terrible eyes.  Switching gears now, I'd like to talk  about the crime situation here in Quahog.  Joining me now is white-haired contributor Peter Griffin.  Peter, what are you hearing about crime in Quahog?  Uh you know, not much.  Not much? Excuse us for one moment.  - What are you doing?! - What?  I don't know anything about crime.  So? People want to know that bad stuff's going on out there.  That's why they watch the news.  - You want me to make stuff up? - I don't know.  I thought you had white hair.  - You're right, I do. - Of course you do.  (GASPS, GIGGLES)  Now, you were talking about crime?  Crime is way up, and you know why?  'Cause of immigrants.  I say, as Americans,  we should all take a pledge to kick 'em out.  Only pledge I stand for is Lemon Pledge.  (SQUEAKING)  Peter Griffin, white hair, very credible, thank you so much.  Coming up, lost dog comes home  one piece at a time.  (NEWS THEME MUSIC PLAYS)  Peter, that was amazing.  I'm the news director here at Channel Five.  How would you like to do what you just did every night?  Wipe a bloody booger under the desk?  No, I'm asking you to join us full-time  to be our permanent senior analyst.  Would you excuse me while I step into another room  and celebrate like a girl in a Rom-com who just got good news?  Aah! The Sanguelto!  My blood's thinner than water!  - (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) - If taking Sanguelto,  please refrain from dancing like in a Rom-com,  as nosebleeds may be permanent.  And remember, most drugs are prescribed to you  because a hot girl with a rolling suitcase  gave your doctor a free pen.  Peter, what the hell do you think you're doing?  Who says you can just make things up and call them facts?  Tom Tucker did. He kissed me.  You have a responsibility as a member of the press  to report the news accurately.  You can't just say crazy things that aren't in any way true.  JOE (LAUGHING): Yeah, leave that to the yahoos in D.C.  - Did that get a \"That's So Joe\"? - No!  Okay, well, what are the rules on that?  We're still working that out.  Well, let me know when you decide on the rules.  I'm really excited about working on this.  With you guys.  Chris, welcome to the lingerie department.  What are we doing here?  When I was young, seeing these half-naked mannequins  was all I needed to get me going.  What's the endgame here  Him walking around Macy's with a chub?  No, we've got to reset his arousal meter.  He needs to be able to use his imagination again.  Any of these mannequins doing anything for you, Chris?  Uh, I don't know.  I guess the one without a head is pretty cool.  All right, that's that's something.  And that bin of chopped-up ones over there that could be okay.  'Specially the one that looks kind of afraid.  There you go. Look at you.  Sounds like someone is ready for that date.  Do you gentlemen need any help?  No, thank you, dear.  We're just trying to get my brother to full mast.  We want to welcome back our new permanent senior analyst,  Peter Griffin and his white hair.  What's the latest on crime in Quahog?  - Tom, crime is up. - Wow. How high?  - All the way to the top. - Whoa. The top.  Has it ever been all the way to the top before, Peter?  Never. In fact, we had to raise the top.  So, the new top is even higher than the old top?  Yes, the old top is now the middle.  And The Middle is a show  that was inexplicably on ABC for a very long time.  How many seasons?  It might be, like, 11. I'm not even kidding.  Peter Griffin, white hair, very credible, thank you so much.  Coming up, we'll tell you where to look  when a person has a birthmark on their face.  So, Chris, have you weaned yourself off of Internet porn?  Wait. I thought the whole point was to not wean myself off.  No, Chris, I mean, have you stopped? Never mind.  - You ready for your date? - You bet I am!  (KNOCKING)  Hi, Chris.  (LAUGHING)  Hi, Kristen.  Ready to see a Marvel movie, 'cause I chose?  Sure.

I just want to go home.  Oh, you can't go home yet!  We haven't even served dinner.  And I hope you saved your appetite,  because, later, we're all wiping our ass  with the Constitution.  Hi, Brian Griffin.  They let me write some of the liberal jokes.  How you liking 'em?  Good, there's more coming.  Folks, to drink this evening, we've got red wine,  white wine, and a fifth of bourbon.  What'll you have, disgraced political oddity Roger Stone?  I'll take the fifth.  (CHUCKLES) That works on two levels.  Layered.  Man, the Trump White House is so awesome.  And for sure it's not crawling with Russians.  (RUSSIAN ACCENT): That's for actual,  other American at this party.  So, what kinds of things  do you hearing from our Mr. USA President?  I don't know, fellow American,  but here's my Gmail log-in and password,  'cause I know I can trust you with it.  Wonderful.  Now, to please excuse,  I have very aching gut from eating so much apple cake.  Ha!

Oh. Yeah.  Sorry to be out of sorts. I just  Sometimes I wish I could meet someone else  whose dad is a fat idiot who once had a hit television show  and who, over time, has worn out his welcome.  - You know, Meg's dad is als - Shut up, Tiffany.  Yeah. Shut up, Tiffany.  Meg, I think you'd look amazing  in my brand of lifestyle products  that are designed to represent a poor person's idea  of what a rich person would wear.  - You think so? - Trust me.  When I'm done with you, you'll be pretty enough to marry  an Orthodox Jewish son of a felon  who's too stupid to get into Harvard the normal way.  And whose voice is way higher than you thought it would be?  (HIGH-PITCHE): Hi, honey. Ready for dinner?  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Stewie, where have you been?  (RUSSIAN ACCENT): Ugh, many American baby things am I doing.  So, what is your favorite ballistic missile launch codes?  Whoa, is that Meg?    That girl is pretty.  So pretty by D.C. standards.  With Geico, you can save up to 15% on car insurance.  Wow!

BUSH: Hey, Barbara Bush, working late.  Sleeping in office.  Crazy headache.  You look like my mom.  Good afternoon, I'm Tim Tucker,  not my twin brother, Tom.  Our top story: mentally challenged boys' T-shirts.  Are they getting even longer?  Um, guys, I got to tell you something.  Last night, at the White House,  President Trump touched me inappropriately.  - What?! - Meg, that's my boss, all right?  This is my career you're talking about.  I spent a whole day working on this.  You want me to just throw away in one day  what I've spent a whole day trying to build?  A whole day's worth of work, poof, gone in a day!  Meg, you expect us to believe  that the president of the United States  would grab a woman by her (BLEEP)?  That's ridiculous!  How could you not believe me?  Oh, hang on. CNN's on,  where I'm the loudest guy on an overcrowded panel.  This country needs stronger border security.  Our border security is the strongest in the world.  What we need is to take care of our children.  I can't get an erection!  You think giving them amnesty  is fair to the people who are already here?  They're contributing to the economy.  I've tried all the herbs!  Amnesty is never the answer.  It's not amnesty.  It's recognizing their contributions to our country.  They said to meditate, but I keep fallin' asleep!  We need stronger vetting.  And to enforce the laws already on the books.  I'm terrified of being alone with my wife!  It's too much pressure!  Well, nothing's ever gonna change  if Congress isn't willing to compromise.  - Exactly my point. - A wall would solve this.  I wake up with an erection,  but never when she's in the bed with me!  A wall would solve nothing.  These children have rights.  I spent three grand on a Sandals vacation,  thinking that might do it!  Know what it was?  Me being limp on a lazy river!  Well, that's all the time we have.  - Thank you to Peter Griffin - No!  Don't send me home to my wife!  Democrats.  That's why we went to Sandals?  Dad, did you hear what I said?  Sorry, Meg, I got to go to work.  What? You're still gonna work for that man  - after he assaulted me? - (DOOR CLOSES)  Meg, you got to stop with these stories.  People hate a liar.  Just like closed captioning stenographers hated  the Sleepy Hollow guy for some reason.  Did he carry a broadax?  The mark on his hand  Was it a bow?  Oh, no. No, no, no, it can't be.  When I cut off his head.  Okay, I'll take your questions.  Me With A Fake Mustache.  America wants to know what you're packin' up there.  I've heard 11 inches.

Well, if this lumpy orange garbage vegetable is here,  then where's President Donald Trump?  Mr. President, please,  I'm not interested.  You'll regret this.  (SPEAKS HUTTESE)  (CACKLING)  Oh, my God.  Bob's Burgers is on!  This show speaks to us young people, apparently.  That show and-and I mean no disrespect when I say this  But that show looks like it was animated in a moving car.  And again, no disrespect, wonderful people over there.  But oh, my God, President Trump is assaulting Meg,  I can't believe what I just saw, Mr. President!  What would your third wife,  the soft-core girl-on-girl porn lady, think about this?  Or the actual porn star your lawyer paid hush money to?  I'm so sorry we didn't believe you earlier, sweetie.  Yeah, where do you get off behaving like this?  - Why shouldn't I? You do. - What?  When you walked through that door, you insulted Bob's Burgers  and the hundreds of people who work there.  Well, I was just kidding around.  No, you weren't. You're just jealous  'cause it wins all the Emmys and the kids love it.  You seem to know a lot about Bob's Burgers.  Of course I do.  Bob's Burgers is my favorite animated show.  Wow. There's your headline, Emmy voters.  Vote your conscience.  Anyway, my point is,  if Peter Griffin gets to be a jerk all the time,  then why can't Donald Trump?  Huh.  That is not the dumbest thing you've ever said.  So are we square?  No.  No, President Trump, we are not!  I quit!  - What? - That's right.  And you know what else? My days of being mean  and insulting are over!  From here on out,  I'm gonna be the nice, kind Peter Griffin.  You can't walk out on me.  I'm the president.  Well, you're not a very good one.  Like that guy.  Or-or that one.  Or that one.  Hey, which one is that, anyway?  I'm Grover Cleveland,  the only president to be married in the White House.  Oh, what a nice story.  It's a great story. I married a girl  who I'd raised since the time she was 11 years old.  Oh.  Well, that guy's not getting a musical.  We now return to Pirates of the Caribbean,  where the sound guy put the microphone too close  to Johnny Depp's jangling bracelets.  - (BRACELETS JANGLING) - Hold it right there, Sparrow.  This is the day you will always remember  as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.  - What?! - I said  - (JANGLING CONTINUES) - I've spent $65 million  on vacation homes and daytime wine.  (JANGLING)  All right, turn off that cheap celebrity slam.  The Griffins are gonna be better than that now.  - What? - You heard me.  We are done being mean and insulting,  like Donald Trump is. From now on,  this family's gonna be nice and supportive.  Oh. So if we're being nice now,  maybe you have nice things to say to me, Dad.  Uh of course I do.  Your hair is, um  very hat.  You're a hat owner.  You're also hatted.  Why does he keep coming back to the hat?  Peter, stop. Your nipples are bleeding.  All right, fine, I'm not a nice person.  I'm sick of complimenting your hat!  I knew that fat man couldn't keep this up.  He always buckles under pressure.  Yeah, you're right. Like at that Billy Joel concert.  (PLAYING \"PRESSURE\")  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da   Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da   Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da   Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da   Uptown girl!     PETER: Trump!  Who are you?

I'm just a guy from Rhode Island.  You' the President of the United States!  You're not just a guy from Rhode Island.  You're Peter Griffin from Family Guy.  Many children have learned their favorite Jewish, black  and gay jokes by watching your show over the years.  In fairness, we've been trying to phase out the gay stuff.  But you know what? We're a cartoon.  You can turn us off. You're the president.  We can't turn you off.  And you're on, like, all the time!  Yes, tremendous ratings.  Our Leslie Nielsen ratings are the highest in history.  Surely you can't be serious.  I am serious. And don't call me Leslie.  Argh You really do find a way to screw everything up.  If I screwed up so bad, how come I'm a billionaire?  Billionaire? Please.  You're worth $700 mil on the high side.  And most of that is borrowed or tied up and underwater.  That's why you ain't releasin' your taxes, Trump.  You're cash poor!  Say that again.  I dare you.  You  are cash  poor.    (GRUNTING)  (YELLING)  (GRUNTS)  Peter!

Maybe I can lend a hand, Brian.  I'll help you write your biography.  Really? You-you'd do that?  Yes.

I got some free time.          - Hey, guys, sorry I'm late. - It's about time.  Thanks to you, we got leap-frogged  by Seamus' foursome.  Ha. Golf club hands.  Hey, could one of you spot me the greens fees?  I blew all my money at the massage parlor.  Sheesh, you're sure spending a lot of money at that place.  How much you pay one of them masseuses?  Eh, 200 bucks.  200 bucks?! That's what I paid for Reading Railroad!  What kinda medical benefits do those masseuses get?  I think they see the Chinese vet down the street.  Well, that's all the information I need  to make a binding vocational choice.  Guys, I'm gonna become a professional massage therapist.  - What?! - Are you serious, Peter?  You bet. I could always use some extra cash.  Plus, I've handled bigger challenges before.  You know, I was once in the Blue Man Group.  [RHYTHMIC DRUMBEAT.]    [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]  Peter, what's wrong with your paint?  Remember when I asked for a five-minute break?  Hey, Stewie, which title do you like for the biography,  Barking Up the Right Tree Did you catch that?  Or, Are You There, Dog? It's Me, Brian?  Oh, about that, I was meaning to tell you,  your biography is finished.  Already? Wow. Print me up a copy!  Done, Brian. Look behind you.  Whoa, ass ahoy.  - Classic. - Stewie, this isn't a book.  Brian, it's 2019. We're living in a post-book,  Post Raisin Bran society.  So enjoy your new robot,  and enjoy a bowl of Post Raisin Bran.  Post Raisin Bran: like Kellogg's, but worse!  Stewie, what about my biography?  This robot is a living record of you and your history.  It knows you and your mannerisms,  and it will exist long after you're gone.  Brian, in every sense of the term,  Robot Brian is your biography.  This is how you'll be remembered, forever.  Whoa, ass ahoy.  He says that a lot.  He's also got an interchangeable memory bank,  an expandable encyclopedia database, and, as a bonus,  the new U2 album.  Oh. I don't want the new U2 album.  You don't get a choice.  So this is a robot version of me?  Not just a robot \"version,\" Brian, it's like another you,  uploaded with your genetic code, your cognitive patterns,  and your entire life story.  \"Oh, no, Stewie's time machine broke,  and now we are stuck in the history past.\"  Well, that is one of my catchphrases.  I don't talk that robotically, though.  That'll go away.

And his towel keeps falling off,  and he keeps saying, \"Oops.\"  I dunno, the towels here are very fally-offy.  Dammit. Good-bye, Peter.  - Where you goin'? - Home.  I can't come here anymore, you've made it weird.  You have one that looks like snowboarder Chloe Kim?  She turned 18, so I can say that out loud now.  Robot Brian, it's so great that you're here.  I need a partner for a project I've been working on.  But, sir, Dogbook was our idea.  It was stolen by Bark Zuckerbark.  And who are you again?  We're the Barklevoss twins. And scene.  So, what do you think?  I think it's great. I have no notes.  It's called The Barkial Network.  How come you didn't call it Barkbook?  [SNIDE CHUCKLE.] I thought you said you didn't have any notes.  I got you dropped from jury duty.  Oh, great.

All these women are prostitutes.  Cuff them, cop with a wife who's taller than him.  Uh, my name's Gary.  I'm sorry, I'm bad with names,  but I'm good at remembering gigantic wives.  So, what was Brittany Babbit like?  Oh, you know, at Applebee's, she's all like,  \"Hi, may I take your order?\" and at her bedroom window,  she's all like, \"Ah, get out of here.  How'd you find my apartment?\"  Tale of two Brittanys, huh?  Yeah, I mean, if you don't want me showing up at your house,  don't put a smiley face on my receipt.  Uh, Your Honor, the defense rests.  See, you get it.  Have you read my book yet?  I'm downloading it right now.  It's beautiful.  - Mm - Mm  Yeah, this is, this is fine.  This isn't, this isn't weird.  I'm a robot you. Mm.  ANNOUNCER: Post Raisin Bran.  Proud sponsor of whatever the hell's going on here.  - Good morning, Brian. - Hey.  So, anything unusual happen with Robot Brian last night?  Anything you'd like to share?  N-No. W-Why, why do you ask?  Well, as it happens, your robot has a rear panel sensor.  Every time it's triggered, I get a text, like a Google Alert.  [PHONE CHIMING.]  I This is ridiculous.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  Mm-hmm. You know he backs up his hard drive every night, right?  Though I guess you were also backing up  his hard drive last night, eh?  Wiping that history?  Ah, what else? What other computer terms  What, the oh, getting some RAM?  A few megabytes?  Logging in and logging out wow,  there's a lot of computer things that sound dirty.  Okay, I admit it. I'm not made of stone.  I fell for me.  I know it seems strange, but I'm gonna give it a chance.  And don't worry, we're not gonna be one of those cutesy couples.  - Morning, RB. - \"RB?\"  Yeah, it stands for \"Real Brian\".  Morning, RB. \"Robot Brian.\"  Well, much like every other \"RBs,\"  you are making me sick.  Hey, did you get the license plate of that handsome guy  who ran me over last night?  Ha, ha, clever.  So is there anything we need to talk about?  I don't know. Is there anything we need to talk about?  - I guess not. - Well, I guess not, too.  - Thanks, RB. - Back at you, RB.  We just click together.  Like all the pieces in Chris's first model set.  Okay, lay out the pieces, find the cockpit,  open the glue, take a sniff  [INHALES SHARPLY.]   and this will be my life now.  Joe, you got to help me.  My picture's in the paper and everything.      Well, everybody knew that Bob Iger thing,  but you got to help me, Joe.  No way. You should've thought of that before you committed  a victimless crime between consenting adults  in a commercial arrangement which also created jobs  and contributed tax dollars to the community.  Now if you'll excuse me,  I'm gonna go watch Bob Iger drain threes at the local gym.  We've got to think of something to make Joe drop the charges.  I don't know, he seemed pretty insistent.  Trust me, Joe can be pretty easily influenced.  -  I get knocked down  - Oh, no!  -  But I get up again  - Yeah!  -  You're never gonna keep me down  - Good!  -  I get knocked down  - Oh, no!  -  But I get up again  - Yeah!  You're never gonna keep me   [LIPS SMACK.] Ah  [LIPS SMACK.] Ah  Sounds like that water's pretty refreshing, huh?  - Excuse me? - No, nothing, you just made a weird noise  after you took that sip of water.  RB, that's the sound you make when you take a sip of water.  What? No way, that's so annoying.  I'd-I'd kill myself if I sounded like that.  Brian, don't forget, I'm you.  Everything I do, I literally got from you.  Well, not that.  I think I know how to take a sip of water  without sounding like a rock concert drum solo.  Go ahead. Show me.  Hmm? Mm-mm.  Mm-mm-mm-mm.  [LIPS SMACK.] Ah  Joe's police rounds bring him down this street.  So the plan is, we trick him into coming in  and getting an erotic massage.  Then we blackmail him into dropping Peter's charges.  Right. And if someone makes a joke about my weight,  I laugh good-naturedly and then go home and eat my feelings.  O-Okay. That-that's part of the plan you keep on the inside.  Yeah. Next to the pizza you had for breakfast.  [LAUGHS.]  Here comes Joe. Places.  La, la, la, la, unsuspecting song   Huh. \"Miracle Leg Massage. Walk Again, Joe.\"  I don't know. What's the name of this place, anyway?  \"Flip Joke Massage Parlor.\"  Well, tempted as I may be,  there is no way I'm going in there for a massage.  Ma'am, I assume you're giving me a great message,  but that's where it stops.  I'll be a monkey's uncle before I accept a sexual favor.  And that's the story of how your mother my sister  got into college.  [BABBLES.]  [LAUGHS.]: Oh, Barnaby Bananas.  You're certainly my smartest nephew,  but Harvard is only for humans.  No monkey will ever graduate from there.    Barnaby Bananas.  [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING.]  I tell you, Janine, I sure feel dumb for what I said earlier.  Congratulations, Janine. Also, Joe,  we got pictures of you getting a sexual favor a while back,  so now you got to drop the charges.  This'll never stick, Peter.  I know a top-notch Harvard-trained lawyer.  [BABBLES.]  An M.A. in urban planning?  That's no help. All right, Peter, you win.  - Really? - Yup, I'm gonna drop all the charges.  And now maybe you could drop a few LBs, huh?  [LAUGHTER.]  [LAUGHTER OVER TELEVISION.]  [LAUGHS.]  - What?! - What?  I do not laugh like that.  Again, Brian, I'm you.  I can't do it unless you've already done it.  You can't do it unless I've already done it?  What is this, Bark to the Future?  [BOTH LAUGH.]  Oh, my God, I do do that.  Hey, Brian, I think I put in a good day of writing.  Check out what I did.  - This is a blank screen. - Exactly.  I spent all day working on the margins.  - The margins? - Oh, yeah,  you got to get the margins right.  They frame the page.  They're like the corral, and the words are my wild horses.  It's my job to break those word horses  and ride them off into the green pastures of prose and poetry.  Stop! It's just so pretentious.  Well, they're your words.  No way. I would never say that.  Words are my wild horses.  It's my job to break those word horses  and ride them off into the green pastures of prose and poetry.  Sir, all I said was your Discover card was declined.  Turn it off, turn it off!  God, I'm such a jerk.  I hate you!  Which means I hate me.  What did you just say?  I said I hate me. I hate myself.  You've made me realize I hate myself.  [WHIRS.]  - What the - [SLOW CLAP.]  Well done, Brian, well done.  Stewie? What are you doing? What the hell happened to RB?  - RB served his purpose. - Which was what?  To show you that the last thing you need is a detailed account  - of who you are and what you do. - Excuse me?  Brian, you wanted to write your autobiography.  And I needed to show you that no one  wants to read your autobiography, not even you.  - Because - Because your best is middling,  your worst is intolerable, and when you die,  the most you'll want written about you  is \"He Was a Good Boy\" on your tombstone.  And even that will be a complete lie.    I couldn't do it. I couldn't lie.  TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to The Talking Talking Dead,  the show that talks about the show  that talks about The Walking Dead.  Okay, so what do we think about what they thought about stuff?  It was awesome. Oh, my God, it was so great  how they thought that other show was so great.  Yeah, totally. And that one part of the show  where the guy was talking about that one part of the other show  and how he didn't see that coming?  I did not see that coming.  This is just too much to process.  I need an aftershow after this aftershow,  just to know what I just saw about  what I just saw about what I just saw.  - Well done, Chris. - Thank you.  And Brian, you certainly had yourself an adventure.  I sure did.  Hey, whatever happened to Robot Brian anyway?  He moved down to the marina.  I hear he's doing pretty well.  [PHONE CHIMING.]  It's been like this all morning.  I'm actually starting to get a little worried, you know?  It's not a bionic robot.  - It can break. - [PHONE WHOOSHES.]  What's that swoosh?  He's got a mouth sensor, too.  And remember, Brian, he wouldn't do anything you wouldn't do.  - He's you. - [PHONE WHOOSHING, CHIMING.]  It's rather musical, isn't it?  Sounds like the \"Carol of the Bells.\"  [\"CAROL OF THE BELLS\" PLAYING OVER PHONE.]  - [PHONE VIBRATING.] - Uhp, I'm getting a call.  Oh, no, it's Allison Janney. Decline, decline.  I tell you, Lois, being a masseuse is a tough job.  But it all just goes to show that basically  every licensed massage therapist in this country is a prostitute.  Oh, yeah. You can pretty much do whatever you want  with any masseuse ever, because they're all prostitutes.  And it's not just the masseuses.  If you're ever seeing, like, a physical therapist,  or doing yoga with a private instructor?  Just go for it.  There's, like, an 80% chance you'll get there.  But Peter, there's, there's one thing I still don't get.  Why did you take the massage job in the first place?  For you, Lois. I did it to earn enough money  to buy a comb for your beautiful hair.  Oh, Peter, didn't you know?  I sold my beautiful hair to buy you a bottle of massage oil.  Great. So now I'm an unemployed masseuse with a bald wife.  Merry [BLEEP.] Christmas.   (SINGSONGY): Stone fruit season!  Now, those are what my granddaddy called  \"proposin' peaches.\"  Don't be shy, now.

I'm trans-listening.  Well, as such, you're entitled to supplemental time off,  our on-site masseuse  and a $60 gift card from Nordstrom Rack.  - Nordstrom?! - Rack.  - Yeah, but Nordstrom! - Yes, I understand.  But it's just Rack.  Well, in the words of trailblazer Caitlyn Jenner,  \"I will do anything for money and attention.\"  So brave.  Great. We'll send the paperwork down to your office.  Well, better use the men's room one last time.  Lot of history in there.    You.  And you, the Hungry Hungry Hippo.  You'd always swallow it before I could see what I did.  And one last look at my crack imprint on the walk of fame.  God, I remember that day.  I would find out later  that when you put your ass in wet cement,  you're just sealing it shut forever.  Best they could do was poke holes in it  so it comes out like Play-Doh spaghetti.  Anyway, that's the first act.  Peter, pretending to be transgender to get time off work  trivializes a real struggle in this country.  Did the did the Space Cats get to you?  I don't know what that is, but you got to knock this off.  And direct me to Earth's reserve of sun-dappled window seats.  Lois is right, Peter.  Besides the fact that you're lying to your employers,  you're taking advantage of a civil liberty  that so many oppressed people  have fought their entire lives for.  Shut your mouth, Brian. I'm part of a movement.  Hey, what is \"transgender,\" anyway?  Is that the stuff in potato chips  that makes your bum go bam?  (GROANS) It-It's pointless arguing with you.  Cool. Now, in order to pull this off,  I'm gonna have to look the part.  Lois, which dress may I borrow?  None. My closet is off-limits.  Fine. There's got to be something in the attic.  I can't even begin to describe the density of illness  I feel in my bone marrow right now.  That is-that is how appalled I am by this.  - Other guys? - Sorry, Peter.  I don't see you getting away with this one.  Look, Peter, the good news is  you still fit in your wife's wedding gown.  Not every guy can say that.  It's actually Meg's. She commits murders in it.  What's this, now?  That's just it, Peter this whole thing is a joke to you.  Are you forgetting I have a dad who's a woman?  No, of course not. That's the first thing  everyone thinks of when they see you.  But Th-this isn't like that.  And I thought you guys would support me.  Like we all supported Joe on that road trip.  - Boy, I am stuffed. - Oh, I forgot to mention,  one of you guys has to be in charge  of changing my diaper the whole trip.  Why don't we all just switch off?  Oh, there will be other jobs for other people.  Okay, I guess we should, like, draw straws or something.  Actually, I've been observing all of you  for the past few hours, and I choose Quagmire.  - What?! Why me? - You've got long fingers.  And I feel like you wouldn't crack  if things start to go south.  (SIGHS) Fine. How do I know when it's time?  Well, I'll turn to you, very sincerely,  and I'll look you right in your eyes,  and I'll say, \"Quagmire, I've got poopies.\"  Ugh.  Now, Quagmire, I've  - You got poopies.

You're up to six inches.  That's two inches past your goal.  It's not important what the goal was.  What's important is this community cares.  Congratulations, Mr. Griffin.  Your surgery was a success.  You're a man again.  Sully was a hero!  Well, I'm glad everything's back to normal.  I'll say.  Dad, you lost a wiener but came out a winner.  (GIGGLES)  Well, that does it for our crossover episode.  Thanks for coming, cast of Bob's Burgers.  We didn't get to do anything.  Show's 22 minutes long.  Not everything makes it to air.  But, hey, you have the floor  if there's something hilarious you want to say.  I'll just sit here and be quiet.  Give us two Emmys worth of amazing.  Maybe a funny burger name? No?  Girl in the bunny ears?  Boy, I love it when characters are expressed by props.  I kind of feel like this is less of a crossover  and more of a roast.  No, a roast is good-natured.   (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)  MAN: Hold the door.  Great. It's that guy I only have one thing in common with.  Hey, Peter. How about that gay encounter we had?  God, every time with this guy.  I'm gonna take the stairs.  Oh, my God, I'm never gonna get up these stairs.  (PANTING)  Okay, it's all right.  I do this every week in the opening credits.  All right, let's see.

No. No, I want to get paid.  Just forgot.  Ugh, look at me.  I haven't felt this out of shape since I took surfing lessons.  Boy, this is harder than I thought.  My arms are getting really tired.  Nah, you're fine.

I'm a man.  'Cause, you know broken hymen.  Boys don't have hymens!  Okay, then I may have just ripped my taint.  Either way, I love that bike!  Hi. Can you help us?  We're trying to locate a lost Big Wh  - (INSECTS BUZZING) - My God,  there's just so  much garbage.  (MOANING)  Yes, we are in search of a Big Wheel  that was erroneously discarded and collected today.  Oh, then it probably came in with the morning load.  Sorry. That term always makes me blush.  But if it just came in, that's bad news.  Usually the newest, top layer of trash  just blows right into the ocean.  Yeah, I'm afraid your Big Wheel may be gones for good.  Dear God, this is horrible!  I'm blind! I'm blind! I'm blind!  Phew. Ooh, something smells good in this box.  I'm blind! I'm blind! I'm blind!  Damn it.

This is exactly the stuff I need to know.  Lois, will you teach me the ways of the middle-aged woman?  All right. I'm a sucker for romance.  Thanks, Lois. This could open up a whole new world for me.  Like one of those kids who gets a device  that allows them to hear for the first time.  - Billy, can you hear? - Yes!  Amazing! This is amazing.  Your mom and I are going to get a divorce.  I'm in love with someone else,  and I didn't want to say it with the silly hands.  Brian, I've been doing research on my Big Wheel.  If it ended up in the ocean,  it most likely has traveled to Garbage Island.  What's Garbage Island?  The other name for the North Atlantic Garbage Patch,  an enormous cluster of man-made debris  floating in the middle of the ocean.  This is terrible. We got to raise awareness,  - let people know about it. - I agree.  It's like a giant garbage whirlpool.  Brian?  You heard me.  Anyway, I'm heading there to find my Big Wheel.  Perhaps you'll come with me.  Boating to an island of garbage?  I'm in.

Sorry.  My, um my-my dad locked himself out of his car.  Oh, sorry. Do you need to help him?  Um, no, uh, no. He, um, he broke, uh  broke the window with his foot.  High heel. My dad's a woman now.  - Oh. - (PHONE VIBRATES)  (CHUCKLES) You're lucky we came here.  I almost suggested Mickey D's.  (LAUGHING): Oh, my God.  That's so informal.  Are you talking about McDonald's?  - (CHUCKLES): Yeah, yeah! - (PHONE VIBRATES)  Another thing I was just thinking about is  \"AMBER Alert, white Honda Accord,  license plate\" Uh, uh, I mean,  Pinterest sure has some neat pictures of sinks.  Doesn't it?  Listen, what if we just bail on dinner  and head back to my place?  Great!

What happened?  He got hit in the throat with a gentleman's dildo.  (LAUGHS) See,  this is why I listen.    (GRUNTING)  (QUAGMIRE GRUNTS)  (BOTH SCREAM)    Mayor West?  (GRUNTING)  Hey, guys. Don't mind me.  I'm gonna go steal that bus driver's identity.  The Celtics are free money tonight!  Well, Lois, you almost had a female president.  I almost had a dog mayor.  I can't believe they canceled the election  after they thought Brian and Mr. Quagmire were dead.  Does that mean we still need a mayor?  ANNOUNCER: It sure does, America.  Who do you think should be the next mayor of Quahog.  Register your votes at fox.com/family-guy.  Your votes don't count. It's a trick.  - They're just tracking your data. - No, it's not. No, it's not.  Is Mr. Quagmire okay after the accident?  Yeah, he's fine. He's having one of his private pool parties.  (WHISPERING): Hey, girls. Thanks for coming.  Is your voice still broken from the accident?  No, no, I-I'm just trying to be quiet.  Grab yourself a drink.  I'm gonna have some chips first.  No, no, no!  Is that a pool party I hear?  Cannonball!  And that was the moment I remembered  Quagmire doesn't have a swimming pool.  (GROANING)  ADAM WEST: I want to be a mayor  in real life.  So I'm here to ask you  to make me the mayor of your town.  Vote for me, Adam West.  It'll be a home run.  Ugh.  It'll be a home run.  - Pow! - (CHEERING)      NA"
